# KSBC OS Implementation Plan: DRUIDS Architecture

## Vision

KSBC OS transforms the concept of organizational infrastructure by embedding revolutionary principles directly into technology. Building on Tails' privacy foundation, it implements DRUIDS (Documentation for Revolutionary Unity, Ideological Development, and Security) - a system where correct organizational practices emerge naturally from daily use.

## Core Problem

Leftist organizations face cascading failures:
- Key organizers burn out, taking irreplaceable knowledge
- Decisions vanish into chat logs
- New members receive inconsistent training
- Groups split without documenting why
- Each generation rediscovers basic principles through painful trial

DRUIDS solves this through persistent, distributed, self-replicating documentation systems.

## Architecture Overview

### Foundation (Tails Heritage)
- Tor-routed networking for anonymity
- Amnesic base system leaving no traces
- Encrypted persistent storage
- AppArmor security confinement
- Live USB deployment

### DRUIDS Components (New)

#### 1. druids-vault
**Purpose**: Organizational memory management
- Git-based knowledge repository
- Cryptographically signed history
- Automatic versioning and backup
- Conflict resolution for distributed edits

#### 2. druids-sync
**Purpose**: Distributed synchronization without central servers
- Peer-to-peer repository syncing
- Onion service mesh networking
- Automatic discovery of organizational nodes
- Bandwidth-aware delta synchronization

#### 3. druids-workflow
**Purpose**: Democratic centralist decision tracking
- Proposal → Discussion → Vote → Implementation pipeline
- Automated minute generation
- Task assignment and tracking
- Decision history with full context

#### 4. druids-obsidian
**Purpose**: Knowledge management interface
- Pre-configured Obsidian with organizational plugins
- Templates for meetings, proposals, critiques
- Automated cross-referencing
- Export to multiple formats

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core DRUIDS Infrastructure (Weeks 1-3)

#### 1.1 Repository Structure
- Create `/config/chroot_local-includes/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/druids/`
- Implement core Git wrapper for organizational features
- Design vault structure and metadata format

#### 1.2 Persistence Integration
```python
class DRUIDSVault(Feature):
    Id = "DRUIDSVault"
    translatable_name = _("DRUIDS Organizational Vault")
    description = _("Persistent storage for organizational memory")
    Bindings = (
        Binding("druids-vault", "/home/amnesia/Persistent/druids-vault"),
        Binding("druids-config", "/home/amnesia/.config/druids"),
    )
    enabled_by_default = True  # Core to KSBC OS mission
```

#### 1.3 Security Model
- Three-tier access: public, candidate, cadre
- GPG signing for all commits
- Encrypted storage with hardware key support

### Phase 2: Obsidian Integration (Weeks 4-5)

#### 2.1 Enhanced Obsidian Setup
- Integrate existing Obsidian plan from original
- Add DRUIDS-specific plugins:
  - Git integration with signing
  - Meeting templates
  - Voting system
  - Task tracking
  - Encrypted notes

#### 2.2 Organizational Templates
- Meeting minutes with automatic formatting
- Proposal templates with voting integration
- Reading group notes with discussion threads
- Campaign planning with task assignment

### Phase 3: Distributed Sync (Weeks 6-8)

#### 3.1 Onion Service Mesh
- Automatic Tor hidden service creation
- Peer discovery through shared secrets
- Bandwidth-efficient sync protocols

#### 3.2 Conflict Resolution
- Three-way merge for documents
- Voting mechanism for conflicts
- Audit trail for all changes

### Phase 4: Workflow Automation (Weeks 9-10)

#### 4.1 Democratic Centralist Pipeline
- GitHub Issues integration for proposals
- Automated notifications for votes
- Implementation tracking
- Feedback loops to decisions

#### 4.2 Meeting Facilitation
- Agenda generation from open items
- Time tracking for speakers
- Automatic action item extraction
- Follow-up reminders

### Phase 5: Hardware Security (Weeks 11-12)

#### 5.1 Hardware Key Integration
- Feitian K9D support (from original plan)
- YubiKey compatibility
- GPG signing enforcement
- Emergency recovery procedures

#### 5.2 Multi-factor Authentication
- Hardware key + passphrase
- Emergency codes in sealed envelopes
- Social recovery mechanisms

## Critical Features

### 1. No Single Point of Failure
- Every node has complete organizational history
- Mesh networking prevents isolation
- Social graphs for trust verification

### 2. Ideological Coherence
- Git blame shows ideological development
- Fork tracking for splits
- Merge capability for reunification

### 3. Embedded Discipline
- Workflows make correct process easier
- Automation reduces human error
- Audit trails ensure accountability

### 4. Revolutionary Reproducibility
- Complete system cloneable to USB
- Organizational templates included
- One command deployment

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model
1. **State surveillance**: All network traffic through Tor
2. **Physical seizure**: Encrypted storage, plausible deniability
3. **Infiltration**: Cryptographic signatures, social verification
4. **Burnout**: Knowledge persists beyond individuals

### Operational Security
- No cloud dependencies
- No corporate platforms
- Fully air-gappable
- Selective sync for sensitive materials

## Testing Strategy

### Technical Testing
- Unit tests for DRUIDS components
- Integration tests with Tails features
- Security audits by trusted comrades
- Penetration testing

### Organizational Testing
- Pilot with KSBC leadership
- Gradual rollout to chapters
- Feedback incorporation
- Training material development

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- 100% Git operations through Tor
- <5 minute sync for 1GB vault
- Zero plaintext leaks
- Successful recovery from node loss

### Organizational
- Meeting records searchable and complete
- Decision implementation trackable
- New member onboarding <1 hour
- Knowledge persists through leadership changes

## Migration Path

### From Current Systems
1. Export existing documents
2. Import into DRUIDS vault
3. Train on new workflows
4. Gradual transition period
5. Full cutover with backup

### Documentation Migration
- Wiki content to Obsidian
- Chat logs to structured records
- Email threads to decision documents
- Google Docs to Git-tracked markdown

## Maintenance Model

### Technical Updates
- Monthly security patches
- Quarterly feature releases
- Annual major versions
- Emergency response team

### Community Governance
- Users committee for priorities
- Security team for audits
- Documentation team for guides
- Development collective

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b druids-core
   ```

2. **Create DRUIDS module structure**
   - Python package skeleton
   - Git integration library
   - Obsidian configuration

3. **Implement basic vault**
   - Initialize repository
   - Add organizational metadata
   - Create first templates

4. **Security hardening**
   - GPG integration
   - Tor configuration
   - Access control

5. **Begin documentation**
   - Developer guide
   - User manual
   - Security practices

## Long-term Vision

KSBC OS becomes the standard infrastructure for revolutionary organizations worldwide. By encoding best practices into technology, it ensures that movements can survive repression, splits, and generational changes while maintaining ideological coherence and operational security.

The system proves that technology isn't neutral - it can be explicitly revolutionary, making collective action feel more natural than individualism, making documentation feel easier than forgetting, making solidarity feel stronger than isolation.

Form governs function. By building the right form, we create revolutionary function.
