Highlights
==========

March spotlighted many vulnerabilities in FOSS infrastructure globally,
sparking some welcome conversations around the sustainability requirements of
FOSS projects.

- First, there was the RFDS Intel CPU vulnerability. The fixed CPU firmware
  [shipped](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/20274) in Tails
  6.1 addresses the vulnerability! 

- Then, March ended with the xz/liblzma almost-apocalypse that the world
  avoided, including Tails users.

In March, we continued investing in the long-term sustainability of Tails:

- We improved the reliability of our test suite. With
  [@segfault](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/segfault), we have been working
  extra hard to make our automated test suite more robust. We are going to keep
  working on improving the experience of development work at Tails in the coming
  months.

- We made good progress in improving redundancies for our most essential
  services. We added backend capacity, and deployed fallback options for our
  website. This had been a priority since earlier this year, when [our website
  went down](https://twitter.com/Tails_live/status/1749815575839391925). 

Releases
========

ðŸ“¢[[We put Tails 6.1 out in the world|news/version_6.1]]! 

Tails 6.1 carries:
    
 - updated _Tor Browser_ and _Thunderbird_

 - improvements to _Tails Cloner_: it can now unmount all filsystems on the
   target device. Since Tails 6.0 auto-mounts partitions on plugged
   removable media, this is quite an important fix!

- fixes to _Video_

To know more, check out the Tails 6.1 [[release notes|news/version_6.1]] and
the
[changelog](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/debian/changelog).

Metrics
=======

Tails was started more than 873,028 times this month. That's a daily average of
over 28,162 boots - the highest this year. Yet!
