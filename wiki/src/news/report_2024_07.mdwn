Highlights
==========

- On our first month back from vacation, we continued making it easier to
  recover from common failure modes without requiring technical expertise: 

  - we drafted an implementation of our design to detect, report, and repair
    corruption of the _Persistent Storage_ 

  - we finished implementing our plans to improve the detection of and recovery
    from low-memory situations. Going from prototype to  implementation, this
    work was a great example of the [90-90
    rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety%E2%80%93ninety_rule) in action: the
    first 90% of the work consumed the first 90% of our  time, and the remaining
    10% accounted for the other 90% of our time 

- Over the past year, we have been close downstream of the Tor Project's design
  and implementation of [Arti](https://tpo.pages.torproject.net/core/arti/).
  This month, we reached a significant milestone in our collaboration: we
  prepared a prototype of Tails in which multiple applications use Arti. 

- [freiheitsfoo](https://freiheitsfoo.de/), one of our longest supporters,
  renewed their sponsorship of Tails!  Welcome aboard for another year of
  resisting censorship and surveillance online!

Releases
========

ðŸ“¢[[We released Tails 6.5|news/version_6.5]]! 

In Tails 6.5, we brought:
    
- an updated _Tor Browser_ with [cool letterboxing
  improvements](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-135/), and
  the latest Debian (12.6)

- repairs to first-boot partitioning that many users were facing issues with
  after Tails 6.4

- fixes to connecting via mobile broadband, LTE, and PPPoE DS. This has been a
  persistent issue in the Tails 6 series so far.
