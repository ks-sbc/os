<h2>Closing a Tor circuit from <i>Onion Circuits</i></h2>

You can now close a given Tor circuit from the *Onion Circuits* interface. This
can help replace a particularly slow Tor circuit or troubleshoot issues on the
Tor network.

[[!img close_circuit.png link="no" alt=""]]

To close a Tor circuit:

1. [[Connect to the Tor network.|doc/anonymous_internet/tor]]

1. Choose [[!img lib/symbolic/tor-connected.png alt="Tor status menu"
   link="no" class="symbolic"]]&nbsp;â–¸ **Open Onion Circuits** in the top
   navigation bar.

1. Right-click (on Mac, click with two fingers) on the circuit that you want
   to close.

1. Choose **Close this circuit** in the shortcut menu.

   When you close a circuit that is being used by an application, your
   application gets disconnected from this destination service.

   For example, when you close a circuit while <i>Tor Browser</i> is
   downloading a file, the download fails.

1. If you connect to the same destination server again, Tor uses a different
   circuit to replace the circuit that you closed.

   For example, if you download the same file again, Tor uses a new circuit.

<h2>Addition of <span class="code">sq-keyring-linter</span></h2>

At the request of people who use [SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org/) to
provide secure whistleblowing platforms across the world, we added the
[`sq-keyring-linter`](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rust-sequoia-keyring-linter)
package. `sq-keyring-linter` improves the cryptographic parameters of PGP keys
stored in their airgapped machines.
