<h1 id="features">New features</h1>

We added 21 new languages to the Welcome Screen: Albanian, Armenian, Basque,
Bengali, Bulgarian, Estonian, Galician, Icelandic, Japanese, Kazakh, Korean,
Latvian, Malay, Norwegian Nynorsk, Polish, Serbian, Slovak, Swahili, Thai,
Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.

Some of these languages only have little of our custom Tails applications
translated, but other applications included in Tails are better translated.

If you want to translate Tails better in these languages or translate Tails
into other languages, you can contribute to the [Tor Project
Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/tor/tails-gui/).

New languages will be included automatically in future versions of Tails as
soon as 25% of strings are translated.

## To upgrade your Tails USB stick and keep your Persistent Storage

  You can [[reduce the size of the download|doc/upgrade#reduce]] of future

  automatic upgrade, please try to do a [[manual upgrade|doc/upgrade/#manual]].
