  Fundraising Lead. bokonon will help us develop and grow our fundraising
  initiatives, to support the work we do to accomplish our

Releases
========

We [[released Tails 5.10 on February 16|news/version_5.10]].

As part of our focus on polishing user experience, Tails now asks for
confirmation when starting without unlocking the Persistent Storage. Because we
humans sometimes forget stuff. It's OK :)

Tails 5.10 fixed a few problems introduced in Tails 5.8 in December,
and some more:

- Fixed another case of Persistent Storage not activating.
  ([[!tails_ticket 19432]])

- Avoid opening the Persistent Storage settings each time after login.
  ([[!tails_ticket 19410]])

- Solve a possible privilege escalation through a symlink attack.

Metrics
=======

Tails has been started more than 652 918 times this month. This makes 23 318
boots a day on average.
