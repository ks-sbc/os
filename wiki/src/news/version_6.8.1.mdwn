This release is an emergency release to fix a critical security
vulnerability in *Tor Browser*.

<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Update *Tor Browser* to
  [13.5.7](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-1357), which
  fixes [MFSA 2024-51](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2024-51/),
  a major use-after-free vulnerability. Using this vulnerability, an attacker
  could take control of *Tor Browser*, but probably not deanonymize you in
  Tails.
