This release is an emergency release to fix a critical vulnerability in the
*Linux* kernel.

<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Update the *Linux* kernel to 6.1.38.

  This update fixes:

  * [Downfall](https://downfall.page/) on Intel processors ([CVE-2022-40982](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-40982))
  * Inception on AMD processors ([CVE-2023-20569](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20569))

  These vulnerabilities could allow a malicious application running in Tails to
  access and steal data from another application in Tails, for example
  passwords stored in *KeePassXC* or private keys stored in *Electrum*.

  This attack is unlikely, but could be performed by a strong attacker, such as
  a government or a hacking firm. We are not aware of this attack being used in
  the wild.
