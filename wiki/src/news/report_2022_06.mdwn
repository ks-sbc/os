[[!meta date="Mon, 11 Jul 2022 09:21:12 +0200"]]
[[!pagetemplate template="news.tmpl"]]

Here are a few highlights about what we did in May, among many other things:

 - Our [[helpdesk email|support]] now has auto-reply ([[!tails_ticket 17935]]).

 - Improved the UX of _Tor Connection_: people that were "exploring" the interface going back and forth used to find the wrong boxes to be automatically checked [[!tails_ticket 18546]]

 - We participated in Tor hackweek. It was very fun and very useful!

   - We implemented QR code scanning [[!tails_ticket 18219]]. This seems to work, but it still isn't ready for
     inclusion.

   - We added support for Snowflake [[!tails_ticket 5494]]. Again, this is a PoC: it's nice to see it working,
     but don't expect it to be released so soon.


Releases
========

[[Tails 5.1 was released on June 4|news/version_5.1]]. It fixed an [[important security vulnerability|security/prototype_pollution]], but it also brought many improvements, among which:

 - Improvements for users who leave east of UTC: _Tor Connection_ now automatically fixes the computer clock if you choose to connect to Tor automatically; also, the time displayed in the top navigation uses the time zone selected when fixing the clock in _Tor connection_.

 - _Unsafe browser_ got a new homepage, which makes it easier to understand how to sign in to the local network using a captive portal.

After that, 
[[Tails 5.1.1 was released on June 23|news/version_5.1.1]] as an emergency release.


Metrics
