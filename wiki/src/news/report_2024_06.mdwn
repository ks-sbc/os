Highlights
==========

- The European summer is here, and with it are summer holidays! We took some
  time off for some quality rest and recreation. How we vacationed: music
  festivals in Milan, hiking in the Alps, the Sierra Nevada, and the High Sierra,
  and biking in the Pyrenees. We do love the mountains! ‚õ∞Ô∏è

- But before we went away for some quality R&R, we continued making it easier
  for Tails users to recover from the most common failure modes without
  requiring technical expertise: 

  - We finalized a design to detect corruption of the _Persistent Storage_ on a
    Tails USB stick, reporting it to users, and repairing it. 

  - We made incremental progress towards warning Tails users when they have low
    available memory. We don't detect all the problematic cases yet but, when we
    do, GNOME gently notifies the user. 

- We have been working on a [new user journey for
  backups](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/20194#note_236586).
  In June, we finished designing all interfaces and solicited feedback. The
  proposal was well received by 2 volunteers who have contributed code related to
  backups. 

Releases
========

üì¢ [[We released Tails 6.4|news/version_6.4]]! 

In Tails 6.4, we brought:
    
- even stronger cryptographic protections, as Tails now stores a random seed on
  the Tails USB stick
- fixes to make unlocking the _Persisted Storage_ smoother
- more reliable installation of Additional Software, due to a switch to using
  HTTPS addresses instead of onion addresses for the Debian and Tails APT
  repositories

To know more, check out the Tails 6.4 [[release notes|news/version_6.4]] and
the [changelog](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/debian/changelog).
