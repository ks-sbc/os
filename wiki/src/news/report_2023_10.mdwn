Highlights
==========

- In early October, we got together in Rome for a hybrid sprint! We reflected
  on the year so far, our financial health, and plans to make Tails' mission
  more sustainable.

- Our annual fundraiser is
  [[live|news/gift_of_privacy]]! For this year's
  fundraiser, we are reflecting on a year in which progressive, liberatory
  movements battled intense online surveillance from powerful public and
  private actors alike. 

As we enter 2024, make the gift of privacy. We welcome each contribution, no
matter the size. And there are [[many ways to
contribute|donate]]). Spread word!

And while we have you here, consider nominating Tails for support through
[Proton's fundraiser](https://proton.me/blog/lifetime-fundraiser-survey-2023).
Nominations close on 13 November 2023!

- We also have a new sponsor. Please welcome [James
  Seibel](https://jamesseibel.com/) to the community!
