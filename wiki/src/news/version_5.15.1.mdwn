<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Update *Tor Browser* to [12.5](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-125).

  [Tor Browser 12.5](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-125)
  has a new circuit view and better information about onion services.

  [[!img doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser/circuit-view.png link="no"]]

- Support onion service authentication in *Tor Browser*.

  For example, onion service authentication is used by *OnionShare* outside of
  Tails.

<h1 id="fixes">Fixed problems</h1>

- Fix the search of some languages and keyboard layouts. ([[!tails_ticket 19200]])

  [[!img language.png link="no" alt="Searching for 'esp' now returns 'Espa√±ol'"]]

- Make the upgrade of the Persistent Storage more reliable:

  * On some systems, the message "*Upgrading the persistent storage*" was
    displayed every time in Tails 5.14 when Tails failed to upgrade one of the
    cryptographic parameters. ([[!tails_ticket 19734]])

  * On some USB sticks, upgrading the Persistent Storage was too slow and
    failed with the error message "*Upgrade of persistent storage failed*".
    ([[!tails_ticket 19728]])

- Fix opening documentation links from *Tails Installer*. ([[!tails_ticket 19870]])

- Prevent *Tor Browser* to access information about other Tor circuits.
  ([[!tails_ticket 19740]])

- Make the error when scanning the QR code of a bridge more consistent.
  ([[!tails_ticket 19737]])
