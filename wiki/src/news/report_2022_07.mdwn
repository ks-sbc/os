Here are some highlights of what happened in July in Tails-land:

- The Management and Fundraising Teams worked on the fundraising position job
  description, which is now [[live in the website|/jobs/fundraising]].

- The new Project Manager's introductory period is over and we're all very
  happy with the immediate impacts of her work, which already results in better
  planning, organizing and communicating inside the project (see the job
  description above as an example). You rock, disoj! :)

- The UX Team published a new footer in the website (that was in June,
  actually, but it's worth mentioning!).
