"2024 has been a life-changing year for Tails. Weâ€™ve continued doing what we "
"do best -- developing Tails as an accessible shield for privacy, anonymity, "
"and anti-censorship. And you may have heard: [[we merged operations with the "
"Tor Project|/news/tails_tor]]."

"âœŠ This transition couldnâ€™t have come at a more critical time for online and "
"offline freedoms. Civil society is contracting, liberatory struggles are "
"being silenced, and investigative journalists are being surveilled through "
"increasingly sophisticated tools. In this landscape, our merger with the Tor "
"Project isnâ€™t just about operational efficiencies. By joining forces, we are "
"strategically strengthening the infrastructure necessary for responding to "
"these evolving challenges."
