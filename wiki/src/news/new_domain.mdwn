Today, we finished migrating our website to a new domain: [[tails.net|https://tails.net]].

After 14 years using a subdomain of `boum.org`, we finally
found a new home that will be easier for everybody to remember and type. Tails
will become easier to find by the people who need it the most.

The new domain also provides us more autonomy and possibilities for
some technical work.

The former `tails.boum.org` domain will continue working
until further notice, to avoid breaking upgrades and security notifications on
older versions of Tails and external links on the Internet.

Please make sure to update any important pointers you might have or know about.

We want to thank `boum.org` for supporting the project for all these years.
Their support was and continues to be very
valuable! :)
