"We replaced *balenaEtcher* with *Rufus* in our [[installation instructions "

"Since [[January 2019|report_2019_01]], we had been recommending "
"[*balenaEtcher*](https://etcher.balena.io/) to install Tails from Windows "
"and macOS. We loved the simplicity of *balenaEtcher*, which was really "
"easier to use and worked on macOS as well."

"Shortly after, *balenaEtcher* started displaying ads. Although we didn't "
"like that, we initially didn't view it as a significant privacy risk and had "
"no better alternative at the time."

"However, in 2024, the situation changed: *balenaEtcher* started sharing the "
"file name of the image and the model of the USB stick with the Balena "
"company and possibly with third parties. While we have not experienced or "
"heard of any attacks against Tails users stemming from this change, we "
"believe it introduces potential for abuse. To eliminate that risk "
"altogether, we started looking again for alternatives."

"After evaluating [[!tails_ticket 20423 desc=\"7 other tools\"]], we finally "
"chose\n"
"[*Rufus*](https://rufus.ie/). We had [[!tails_ticket 7034 desc=\"tested "
"*Rufus*\n"
"many years ago\"]], even before recommending *balenaEtcher*, but it was "
"much\n"
"harder to use and modified the Tails image in ways that were risky.\n"

"We have not yet replaced *balenaEtcher* in our installation instructions for "
"macOS because *Rufus* doesn't work on macOS. Also, as Tails doesn't work on "
"Apple M1 and M2 processors, people who install Tails from macOS represent "
"less than 10% of installations nowadays."

"Still, we recommend [[2 alternatives for macOS|/install/mac#etcher]]: "
"installing Tails using `dd` on the command line or using [*Raspberry Pi "
"Imager*](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)."
