"Your donations a lion's share [[of our income|donate#income]]. But, this "
"share has reduced in the last couple of years. Globally, philanthropic "
"giving has fallen, in what is yet another symptom of the challenging "
"political and economic conditions we find ourselves in. But this hasn’t "
"tempered our ambitions. Despite these challenges, Tails has gotten bigger "
"and better over the past year. We have spent more time improving Tails this "
"year than any previous year. But to achieve this, we have relied a bit more "
"on support from large, institutional donors."

"autonomy.  Although, this means that we rely on you even more. And hence "
