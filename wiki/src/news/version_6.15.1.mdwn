This release is an emergency release to fix important security
vulnerabilities in Tor Browser.

<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Update *Tor Browser* to [14.5.2](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-1452),
  which fixes [Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2025-37](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2025-37/).
  These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to perform an out-of-bounds read or write on a JavaScript object, but [don't allow breaking out of the Firefox sandbox](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2025/05/17/firefox-security-response-to-pwn2own-2025/).

- Update *Thunderbird* to [128.10.1](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/128.10.1esr/releasenotes/).

- Remove the *Tor Browser* and *Tor Browser (persistent)* folders: they are not
  necessary anymore, thanks to the more flexible confinement of *Tor Browser* we
  introduced in [[Tails 6.14.1|news/version_6.14.1]]. ([[!tails_ticket 15028]])

<h1 id="fixes">Fixed problems</h1>

- Fix the *Unsafe Browser* appearing in the window list with the *Tor Browser* icon.
  ([[!tails_ticket 20934]])

- Make reporting an error using *WhisperBack* more robust.
  ([[!tails_ticket 20921]])

- Fix *USB tethering*. ([[!tails_ticket 20940]])
