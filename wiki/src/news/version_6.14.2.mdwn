This release is an emergency release to fix security vulnerabilities in
the Linux kernel and the implementation of the Perl programming language.

<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Update *Linux* to 6.1.133, which fixes [multiple security
  vulnerabilities](https://www.debian.org/security/2025/dsa-5900-1)
  that may lead to a privilege escalation or information leaks.

- Update *perl* to 5.36.0-7+deb12u2, which fixes a [heap-based buffer overflow
  vulnerability](https://www.debian.org/security/2025/dsa-5902-1),
  which may result in denial of service, or potentially the execution
  of arbitrary code.
