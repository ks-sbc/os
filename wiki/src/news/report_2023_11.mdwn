Highlights
==========

- We had asked [Radically Open
  Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/) to audit Tails. The
  [[results of the audit|/news/audit_by_ROS/]] reinforced Tails credentials as a
  "solid" operating system for preserving anonymity. 

  We were super proactive with addressing the reported vulnerabilities, fixing
  them all within 3 weeks of being reported. This is a reminder that as good as
  Tails is, it needs to be updated regularly!

* We undertook a bunch of home improvement projects for [[our new
  address|/news/new_domain]]. Highlights:
  * the language switcher on the website is more prominent, and also in the website footer,
  * warning buttons display warnings better - in a new colour, and with wrapped text,
  * [[our redesigned security page|/security/]] better showcases the history of our security advisories.

- We have a new sponsor: [igaming.com](https://www.igaming.com/) joined our
  mission! Our donors also received the quarterly newsletter with early
  insights into upcoming Tails features. You, too, could subscribe while making
  [[your next donation|/donate/]]. Help make our [[ongoing
  fundraiser|/news/gift_of_privacy/]] a success!

Releases
========

November featured 2 new versions of Tails: 5.19.1 and 5.20.

[[5.19.1|/news/version_5.19.1/]] was an emergency release. We updated the Tor
client to bring the fix to the [[TROVE-2023-006
vulnerability|https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/team/-/wikis/NetworkTeam/TROVE]]
to Tails users.

And in [[5.20|/news/version_5.20]], we:

- brought the usual, latest updates to Tor Browser and Thunderbird, 

- fixed a security vulnerability in uBlock Origin to protect Tails users from
  advanced browser fingerprinting techniques, and

- continued making Persistent Storage more usable, and made it even easier to
  report issues when it doesn't work through improvements to WhisperBack.

Metrics
=======

Tails was started more than 825,741 times this month. That's a daily average of
over 27,520 boots.
