Highlights
==========

- In case you missed it, we have a new home. In July, we completed the
  migration of the Tails website to a new namespace: `tails.net`.
  [Welcome!](https://tails.net/news/new_domain/index.en.html)

- 2 more sponsors renewed their support for Tails:
  [freiheitsfoo](https://freiheitsfoo.de/) and [Exam
  Success](https://www.examsuccess.com.au/)! We are all very grateful for their
  continued support and generosity. You, too, could sponsor
  Tails.

- We have started work on deciding the next big feature
  for Tails! We are deliberating between adding either
  VPN functionality or messaging applications. We're sure
  you have preferences and pointers for us. Let us know.

Releases
========

[Tails 5.15.1 was released on July 11 2023](https://tails.net/news/version_5.15.1/index.en.html).

- From Tails 5.14 - the previous Tails release - your Persistent Storage
  automatically uses LUKS2 encryption with Argon2id. On some systems, the
  upgrade was facing issues with reliability
  ([#19734](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/19734),
  [#19728](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/19728)). Tails
  5.15.1 fixes these reliability issues. If you are still experiencing issues,
  [WhisperBack](https://tails.net/doc/first_steps/whisperback/index.en.html#whisperback)!Â 

- Tor browser in Tails now supports authenticated onion services in a consistent manner.
