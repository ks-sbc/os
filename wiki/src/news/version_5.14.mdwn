## Automatic migration to LUKS2 and Argon2id

<div class="caution">

<p>The cryptographic parameters of LUKS from Tails 5.12 or earlier are
weak against a state-sponsored attacker with physical access to your
device.</p>

</div>

To use stronger encryption parameters, Tails 5.14 automatically converts
your Persistent Storage to use LUKS2 encryption with Argon2id.

Still, we recommend you change the passphrase of your Persistent Storage
and other LUKS encrypted volumes unless you use a long passphrase of 5
random words or more.

[[Read our security advisory and upgrade guide.|security/argon2id]]

## Full backups from Tails Installer

You can now do a backup of your Persistent Storage from *Tails Installer*
by cloning your Persistent Storage to your backup Tails entirely.

[[!img doc/persistent_storage/backup/clone.png link="no" alt=""]]

You can still use the backup utility to go faster while [[updating your
backup|doc/persistent_storage/backup#updating]].

## Captive portal detection

Tails now detects if you have to sign in to the network using a captive
portal if you choose to connect to Tor automatically.

The error screen appears more quickly and recommends you try to sign in to
the network as the first option.

## Incentive to donate from *Electrum*

Many people use Tails to secure their Bitcoin wallet and donations in
Bitcoin are key to the survival of our project, so we integrated a way to
donate from *Electrum* in Tails.

## To upgrade your Tails USB stick and keep your Persistent Storage

- Automatic upgrades are available from Tails 5.0 or later to 5.14.

  You can [[reduce the size of the download|doc/upgrade#reduce]] of future
  automatic upgrades by doing a manual upgrade to the latest version.

- If you cannot do an automatic upgrade or if Tails fails to start after an
  automatic upgrade, please try to do a [[manual upgrade|doc/upgrade/#manual]].
