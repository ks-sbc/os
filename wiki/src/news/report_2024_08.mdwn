Highlights
==========

In August:

* We continued making it easier for Tails users to recover from the most common
  failure modes:

  - we released the first iteration of our design to detect a partition table
    corruption and advise users about it. 

  - we worked on implementing detection of the _Persistent Storage_ corruption
    on a Tails USB stick, reporting it to users, and repairing it.

* We resumed our work to design a better backup feature for the _Persistent
  Storage_. We integrated the valuable feedback received in July on our design
  proposal for the improved backup feature ([mockups on
  Gitlab](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/20194)).

* We published [[instructions for installing
  Dangerzone|news/dangerzone/]] in Tails. Dangerzone will help Tails users
  convert suspicious documents to safe PDFs. This was a significant milestone:
  this is the first time that we have recommended installing a 3rd party package
  that is not available in Debian.

Releases
