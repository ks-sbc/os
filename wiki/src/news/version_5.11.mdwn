<h1 id="features">New features</h1>

- Tails now uses the [`zram` Linux kernel
  module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zram) to extend the capacity of the computer's memory.

  You can run more applications or use your session for longer periods of time.
  Tails will handle more load before freezing and become slow more
  progressively.

- You can record screencasts using the integrated feature of GNOME. We
  configured this feature to allow unlimited screencasts. See [[screenshot and
  screencast|doc/sensitive_documents/screenshot_and_screencast]].

<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Update *Tor Browser* to [12.0.4](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-1204).

- Update *Thunderbird* to [102.9.0](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/102.9.0/releasenotes/).

- Redesigned the unlocking section of the Welcome Screen.
