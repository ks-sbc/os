Highlights
==========

- We met IRL! It has been close to 1.5 years since we devised our [[3-year
  strategy goals|news/report_2023_01]]. We reflected on our progress, concluded
  that we had a mixed bag of results, and emerged with a good sense of what's
  needed to be done. And all this while discovering the wonders of vegan
  Francesinha and wine ðŸŒž

- Thanks to our volunteer translations teams, Tails' language diversity
  continued improving alongside the language support we added in [[Tails
  6.2|news/version_6.2]].

  Our French, Spanish, and Catalan teams reported more than 50 small issues on
  the content of our website, typos, inconsistency with the tools, and
  accessibility issues. We fixed all of them. In the process of this lovely
  synergy, we also identified opportunities to make this collaboration through
  [[Weblate|contribute/how/translate/with_translation_platform]] smoother in the
  future.

- And, we also completed a bunch of home improvement projects:

    - We added an animation when expanding the collapsible sections in our
      warnings page. Changes should be more noticeable now. ([Gitlab
      issue](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/19202))

    - We also added a "Security/Fixed" pill on security advisories that are
      fixed. As an example, see our advisory on "[[Possible remote attack on
      onion services|security/TROVE-2023-006]]".

    - We also fixed the display of SVG images when JavaScript is disabled. Now,
      we are using PNG by default and adding some JavaScript to enhance images
      back to SVG when useful. ([Gitlab
      issue](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/17805))

    - We replaced the CSS framework Bootstrap on our website with custom and
      modern CSS code. The most challenging page to convert was our [[donation
      page|donate]], and the resulting code is 20% smaller.
