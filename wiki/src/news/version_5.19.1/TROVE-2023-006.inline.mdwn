  The details of TROVE-2023-006 haven't been disclosed by the Tor Project to
  leave time for users to upgrade before revealing more. We only know that the
  Tor Project describes TROVE-2023-006 as a "[*remote triggerable assert on
  onion
  services*](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/team/-/wikis/NetworkTeam/TROVE)".

  Our team thinks that this vulnerability could affect Tails users who are
  creating onion services from their Tails, for example when sharing files or
  publishing a website using *OnionShare*.

  This vulnerability might allow an attacker who already knows your
  *OnionShare* address to make your Tor client crash. A powerful attacker might
  be able to further exploit this crash to reveal your IP address.

  This analysis is only a hypothesis because our team doesn't have access to
  more details about this vulnerability. Still, we are releasing this emergency
  release as a precaution.

  *OnionShare* is the only application included in Tails that creates onion
  services. You are not affected by this vulnerability if you don't use
  *OnionShare* in Tails and only use Tails to connect to onion services and
  don't create onion services using Additional Software.
