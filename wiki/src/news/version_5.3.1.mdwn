This release is an emergency release to fix a security vulnerability in the
*Linux* kernel.

<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Update the *Linux* kernel to 5.10.127-2, which fixes
  [CVE-2022-34918](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-34918),
  a vulnerability that allows applications in Tails to gain administration
  privileges.

  For example, if an attacker was able to exploit other unknown security
  vulnerabilities in *Tor Browser*, they might then use CVE-2022-34918 to take
  full control of your Tails and deanonymize you.

  This attack is very unlikely, but could be performed by a strong attacker,
  such as a government or a hacking firm. We are not aware of this attack being
  used in the wild.

- Update *Thunderbird* to [91.12.0](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/91.12.0/releasenotes/).
