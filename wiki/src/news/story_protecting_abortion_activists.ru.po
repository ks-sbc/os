"In August, we traveled to Brazil to learn how to improve Tails for the many "
"people fighting for social change there. We trained 34 people on Tails: "
"activists, journalists, feminists, and human rights defenders."

"We also met Gabriela, a feminist hacker who has been training low-income "
"women from the Bahia region on using Tails."

"Gabriela introduced these women to Tails by mixing up local culture and "
"privacy technology and presenting Tails as a *patu√°*, a type of Brazilian "

"These women didn't have computers of their own and used the computers at "
"work or in university or the computers of their husbands and boyfriends. "
"Tails is useful for them to work on reproductive rights but also to protect "

"Women working on reproductive rights understand very easily the importance "

"Some of them had their home raided by the police after being denounced for "
"their work on abortion. All the information about their patients was not in "
"their phones, but in their Tails amulet, and the police couldn't find any "
