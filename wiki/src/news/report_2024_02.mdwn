Highlights
==========

Despite the bonus day this year, February flew by pretty quickly! Here's what
we were up to:

- We ended February more resilient and collaborative than when we started. We
  have new tooling to make it easier to work on shared documents, and use XMPP
  more effectively. We also worked to strengthen our front-end services and set
  up the back-end infrastructre to build redundancies into our services.

- In 2021 and 2022, our [[usability tests with human rights defenders in Mexico
  and Brazil|news/improving_in_latam]] prompted several
  improvements in the installation instructions for Tails. Fixing 16 of the
  identified usability issues were remaining, and we fixed them all this month.
  These tests, experiences, and improvements will greatly shape our future
  trainings.

- We finished updating our website for Tails 6.0. Check out the rewritten
  [[recommendation on secure
  deletion|doc/encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion]].Â
