<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Rename *Tails Installer* as *Tails Cloner*. ([[!tails_ticket 16907]])

- Install more printer drivers and enable all printers automatically.
  ([[!tails_ticket 18254]])

- Update *Tor Browser* to
  [12.5.3](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-1253).

- Update *Thunderbird* to
  [102.15.0](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/102.15.0/releasenotes/).

<h1 id="fixes">Fixed problems</h1>

- Fix some failures while unlocking the Persistent Storage. ([[!tails_ticket 19728]])

  Sometimes, *upgrading* the cryptographic parameters of the Persistent Storage
  was taking too long and made *unlocking* the Persistent Storage fail. We
  allowed the *upgrade* to take more time before reporting a failure.

  Please keep reporting errors using
  [[*WhisperBack*|doc/first_steps/whisperback]] if you have problems
  unlocking your Persistent Storage.

For more details, read our [[!tails_gitweb debian/changelog desc="changelog"]].
