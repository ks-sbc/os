Highlights
==========

- Help us test Tails 6.0! A [[release candidate|/news/test_6.0-rc1]] of the
  upcoming Tails 6.0 is out. Tails 6.0 promises to have a lot of exciting
  upgrades and new features. You can help us by testing the [[release
   candidate|/news/test_6.0-rc1]]. We welcome your feedback by February 18 to
  either:
    - [[tails-testers@boum.org|about/contact#tails-testers]] (public mailing list), or 
    - [[tails-support-private@boum.org|about/contact#tails-support-private]] (private email)

- It is all hands on deck for Tails 6.0! We have been upgrading Tails to Debian
  12 ("bookworm"). We were also busy updating all our documentation to be ready
  for Tails 6.0. 1378 edited lines of HTML and Markdown code later, the
  documentation for Tails 6.0 is almost ready.

- We were in the media! [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvDwx6dqrpM)
  [@sajolida](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/sajolida) riffing with our long-time
  illustrator and comrade [Anhdres](https://anhdres.com/) about all things Tails.

  [@groente](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/groente) in conversation with Software
  Engineering Daily about how we interpret our values and mission in light of the
  various use cases of Tails.

Releases
========

[[Tails 5.22|/news/version_5.22]] was our first release of 2024! In Tails 5.22:

- we continued improving the Persistent Storage: 
  - Tails now tries to repair the Persistent Storage if it is broken when you
    unlock it.
  - Tails now does not try to unlock or delete a Persistent Storage that's on a
    read-only USB stick.

- you can now download and upload files using Tor Browser to/from more folders.

- we introduced more robust error messages when installing Tails with Tails
  Cloner. Thanks again to
  [@BenWestgate](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/BenWestgate) for the efforts to
  improve Tails Cloner!
