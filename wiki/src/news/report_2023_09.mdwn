Highlights
==========

- From Tails 5.14, we started asking Tails users to consider donating to Tails
  [[!tails_gitlab tails/tails/-/issues/18023 desc="when they open Electrum"]]. Since
  then, Electrum users on Tails have donated USD 5k towards Tails' mission. We
  are so grateful for your generous support!

- The Tails community had very meaningful and lovely contributions to the
  project. McFly helped solve [[!tails_gitlab tails/tails/-/issues/19194
  desc="an issue"]] some users had while identifying the 'Alt' key on Apple
  keyboards, and also designed some [[!tails_gitlab
  tails/tails/uploads/8f6a6d8401c7a817b1da79e6013c06b2/collective.pdf desc="slick
  business cards"]].  And jawlensky submitted a huge branch with tons of changes
  all over the website. It will take us a few weeks to process it all! 

- We were in Kerala at [DebConf 2023](https://debconf23.debconf.org/). Thank
  you to DebConf for sponsoring our participation.
