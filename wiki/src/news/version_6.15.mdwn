<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Update *Tor Browser* to [14.5.1](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-1451).

- Update the *Linux* kernel to 6.1.135.

<h1 id="fixes">Fixed problems</h1>

  ([[!tails_ticket 20813]])

  ([[!tails_ticket 20899]])

For more details, read our [[!tails_gitweb debian/changelog desc="changelog"]].

<h1 id="issues">Known issues</h1>

- Remove firmware for the Wi-Fi interfaces based on the BCM4301 and BCM4306
  chips. ([[!tails_ticket 20887]])

  We believe that these interfaces are only available on computers that are too
  old to start Tails. Please [[let us know|support#talk]] if your Wi-Fi stopped
  working in Tails 6.15.

- The *Unsafe Browser* appears in the window list bar with the *Tor Browser* icon.
  ([[!tails_ticket 20934]])

- [[Additional software|persistent_storage/additional_software]] may initially
  fail to install the first time you start Tails after upgrading. This should be
  fixed shortly after you connect to Tor.

- Connecting to the Internet with *USB tethering* is broken with some phones.
