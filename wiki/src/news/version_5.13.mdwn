<h1 id="features">New features</h1>

- Add `curl`, a command line tool to download over HTTPS, FTP, and other
  protocols.

  `curl` can be useful for online investigations as an alternative to `wget`.

  Everything you do with `curl` goes through the Tor network. If you want to
  use `curl` on a local network, use `/usr/bin/curl` instead.

<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Use LUKS2 by default for all new Persistent Storage and LUKS encrypted
  volumes. LUKS2 provide stronger cryptography by default.

  We will provide a migration plan from LUKS1 to LUKS2 for existing Persistent
  Storage in Tails 5.14 (early June).

- Update *Tor Browser* to [12.0.6](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-1206).

## To upgrade your Tails USB stick and keep your Persistent Storage

  You can [[reduce the size of the download|doc/upgrade#reduce]] of future

  automatic upgrade, please try to do a [[manual upgrade|doc/upgrade/#manual]].
