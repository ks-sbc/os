In March 2023, [Radically Open
Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/) conducted a security audit on
the major improvements that we released in [[Tails 5.8|version_5.8]] (December
2022) on the Persistent Storage, the Unsafe Browser, and the Wayland
integration.

To better protect our users, we addressed most of the security vulnerabilities
as soon as they were discovered and reported to us, without waiting for the
audit to be complete and public. We can now share with your the [final
report](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/uploads/df935595f41faa687805136a6bfa2910/tails-ros-penetration-test-report-1-2.pdf).

We are proud of the conclusion of the auditors:

> ***Overall, the Tails operating system left a solid impression and addressed
> most of the concerns of an average user in need of anonymity.***
>
> *This is particularly evident in the isolation of various components by the
> developers. For example, the configured AppArmor rules often prevented a
> significant impact of the found vulnerabilities. Shifting to Wayland was a
> good decision, as it provides more security by isolating individual GUI
> applications.*
>
> *All in all, no serious vulnerabilities were found through the integration
> into Wayland. Unsafe Browser and Persistent Storage should now be less
> vulnerable to attack, as all vulnerabilities have been fixed.*

The auditors found 6 *High*, 1 *Moderate*, 3 *Low*-severity issues. Another
issue was fixed before the actual impact was assessed and so marked as having
*Unknown* severity.

We fixed all these issues as soon as possible and before making them public on
our GitLab. The last issue was fixed in 5.14, 3 weeks after it was reported to
us.

As good as the results of this audit are, they also serve as a reminder that no
software is ever 100% secure and that every release of Tails can fix critical
security vulnerabilities. Your best protection against all kinds of attack is
to keep your Tails up-to-date.

Because at Tails we believe that transparency is key to building trust, all the
code of our software is public and the results of this audit as well. You can
find below a summary of all the issues and their fixes.
