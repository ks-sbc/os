Robin is an activist in struggle against a nuclear project in France. He has
been using Tails as his default operating system for all his activism since 5
years, creating a clear separation between his activism (using Tails) and
personal life (using encrypted Debian).

At his place, many nomadic activists use Tails USB sticks instead of having
personal computers, allowing them to maintain privacy while using shared
devices.

After facing repression, encrypting all their data became a baseline practice
in his group. He prefers training others on Tails because it's easier to
implement than teaching full computer encryption.

> able to use it. For the security of a group, what matters is the lowest
> security level within that group.*
