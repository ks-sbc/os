Highlights
==========

- Spoiler alert! We are working on friendlier ways to back up _Persistent
  Storage_. We are working on a new flow that adapts _Tails Cloner_ to the
  different stages of making backups (setting up, reminding, and updating) and
  integrating it with the _Persistent Storage_ settings. 

- We continued investing in making our infrastructure and services more robust,
  usable, and secure:

    - We continued making the development at Tails more pleasurable. Our test
      suite is much kinder to Tails developers now.

    - We fixed all the broken links on our website (hundreds!). We have now
      implemented a monthly automated check for new broken links.

    - Our new server is now breaking into a sweat! We deployed new internal
      services and made good progress in creating redundancies of our website
      and email systems.
    
- We have a new [[sponsor|sponsors]]: Start Small Foundation! The generous (our
  largest ever, too) donation significantly prolongs our financial runway in
  the short to medium-term. We plan to use this platform to keep improving our
  infrastructure, and build on this platform to bring exciting, new functionality
  to Tails!
