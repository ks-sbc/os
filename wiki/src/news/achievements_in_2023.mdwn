**Malicious actors upped the ante in 2023.**

So-called artificial intelligence systems soared in popularity, supercharging
political
[disinformation](https://www.wired.com/story/slovakias-election-deepfakes-show-ai-is-a-danger-to-democracy/)
[programs](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/19/ai-generated-disinformation-us-elections).
Internet shutdowns and slowdowns became [firmly
entrenched](https://www.accessnow.org/publication/internet-shutdowns-in-2023-mid-year-update/)
in authoritarian toolkits to censor progressive speech. And the [continuing
revelations](https://securitylab.amnesty.org/latest/2023/11/serbia-civil-society-threatened-by-spyware/)
of zero-click attacks drove home the perilous omnipotence of the
military-digital complex.

**But, we also made plans to call their ante.**

We built a state-of-the-art 3-year strategy to make Tails a formidable
adversary to these powerful, repressive forces. We made plans to better
understand the use of Tails by journalists and activists, and understand and
improve the use of Tails in the [majority
world](https://www.harvarddesignmagazine.org/articles/shahidul-alam-on-the-majority-world/).
All this while introducing new features and improvements to existing features
that make Tails even more relevant.

Here's the progress we made in the first year of the plan.

## Product development

**The Persistent Storage got even better at storing encrypted data.**

[[Tails 5.8|news/version_5.8/]] was one of the most important Tails releases in
years. In Tails 5.8, we unveiled a brand new Persistent Storage. The new
Persistent Storage doesn't require restarting after creation or any time after
you activate a new feature. It also made it easier to persist more settings.
The icing on the cake: a dashing makeover for the Persistent Storage!

But the new Persistent Storage wasn't all fun and games for Tails users. It was
buggy and we worked extra hard to fix the issues our users faced.

We didn't stop there. We also continued to add functionality to the Persistent
Storage. Now, it is easier to both do [[backups of the whole Persistent
Storage|news/version_5.14/]] and [[delete the data of a each
feature|news/version_5.12/]].

We also introduced better password practices for securing the Persistent
Storage. Randomly generated [diceware](https://diceware.dmuth.org/) passphrases
and an upgraded encryption format make the Persistent Storage [[exponentially
more secure|security/argon2id]].

**Improvements to the [[Tor Connection|news/version_4.20]] make it easier to
circumvent censorship.**

The Tor Connection Assistant is slicker. We improved the error messaging when
connecting automatically to the Tor network and the handling of captive
portals.

Connecting to Tor is only part of the story. At times, Tails users may find
themselves on slow Tor circuits. And worse, unable to troubleshoot issues. So,
we've made it easier to close pesky Tor circuits that we can sometimes land on.

**Tails remains one of the most secure operating systems in the world.**

This year, we released 15 versions of Tails, ensuring users had the latest Tor
Browser and Thunderbird. Yes, FIFTEEN!

We also asked [Radically Open Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/)
to do a security audit of Tails. Their [[findings|news/audit_by_ROS]] affirmed
our cutting-edge security.

PS: Keeping Tails updated is your best defense against online surveillance and
censorship!

**And we started moving to our new home!**

ðŸŽ‰ âœ¨ tails.net âœ¨ ðŸŽ‰

We completed a bunch of home improvement projects. So our new home is even more
welcoming to folks speaking different languages, we overhauled the language
switcher. We just added Catalan translations too. *GrÃ cies per ser aquÃ­!*

High footfall areas of the website got a new carpet too. Check out our new
[[Contribute|contribute]], [[Support|support]], and [[Contact
us|about/contact]] pages.

A huge shout-out to the volunteers who made these possible:
[@jawlensky](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/jawlensky) for the website redesign
and to our [[Catalan translations team|contribute/how/translate/team/ca]]!

## Community and organizational health

- **Sprints.** Our core team organized 2 sprints this year. Around Easter, we
  bunkered up in Paris. The agenda was budgeting the year ahead and building a
  roadmap to financial health. Also on the agenda: French cheese, spicy Indian
  snacks, and [Dixit](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39856/dixit). Later in
  the year, we met again in a mix of online and in-person participation. We
  reflected on our efforts this year and hatched plans for a more sustainable
  future of the project.

- **Reflections.** Aspiring to reach and encourage more diverse populations of
  Tails users, we also embarked on a path to improving the project's diversity.
  Our core team started meeting fortnightly to reflect on our workplace norms.
  We are using [this text by the Centre for Community
  Organizations](https://coco-net.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Coco-WhiteSupCulture-ENG4.pdf)
  as our guide to reflection and improvement.

## Financial health

Malicious actors are not going to buckle down, but neither are we. This year,
Tails was instrumental in several high-risk investigations and struggles for
progressive change. Like this [damning
indictment](https://nocallaronlasolas.serendipia.digital/) of the Mexican
army's systematic surveillance of feminists in the country.

I, ([@bokonon](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/bokonon)), joined our small team at
Tails this year, to lead our fundraising activities. I have been obsessing over
how a free software project like ours can continue improving Tails while
keeping it free. And one thing is already clear: we will need your help. Often.

While we don't know how many Tails users donate to Tails, our
guess is ~1%. Tails is designed for use by people living vulnerable, high-risk
lives. Many of whom are likely to not be in a position to contribute. Your
donations keep Tails free for everybody else!

We are near the end of our campaign to fund Tails in 2024, but quite a way off
our goals.

We might never have the resources that powerful, malicious actors do, but we
know one thing: together, we can punch much above our weight. As we go into the
holidays, join us in ensuring that the Internet does not become synonymous with
surveillance and censorship. Give the gift of privacy today!
