<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Update *Tor Browser* to [12.0.3](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-1203).

- Ask for confirmation when starting without unlocking the Persistent Storage.

  [[!img unlock.png link="no" alt="Do you really want to start Tails without unlocking your Persistent Storage?"]]

- Update our [[documentation on the Persistent Storage|doc/persistent_storage]].

<h1 id="fixes">Fixed problems</h1>

- Avoid crashing when the download of an upgrade is stopped and resumed. ([[!tails_ticket 18435]])

- Solve a possible privilege escalation through a symlink attack.

  Dennis Brinkrolf discovered that an adversary who could already run arbitrary
  code as the amnesia user in Tails 5.9, could have escalated their privileges
  to reading arbitrary files on the system. It might have been possible to use
  this as part of an exploit chain to gain root privileges.

<h2>Persistent Storage</h2>

- Avoid opening the Persistent Storage settings each time after login.
  ([[!tails_ticket 19410]])

- Solve some cases of failure to activate the Persistent Storage by bumping the
  unlocking timeout to 120 seconds. ([[!tails_ticket 19432]])

For more details, read our [[!tails_gitweb debian/changelog desc="changelog"]].
