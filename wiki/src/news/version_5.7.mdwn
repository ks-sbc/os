## Metadata Cleaner

We added *Metadata Cleaner*, a new tool to clean metadata from your files.

[[!img metadata_cleaner.png link="no" alt=""]]

When we switched to *MAT* 0.8.0 in Tails 4.0, *MAT* lost its graphical
interface and was only accessible from the contextual menu of the *Files*
browser. It became especially hard for new users of Tails to learn how to clean
their files. *Metadata Cleaner* fixes this by providing a simple and easily
discoverable graphic interface to remove metadata.

*Metadata Cleaner* works on the same file formats and is as secure as *MAT*
because *Metadata Cleaner* also uses *MAT* in the background to do the actual
cleaning.

<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Update *Tor Browser* to [11.5.8](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-1158).

- Update *tor* to 0.4.7.11.

- Remove `pdf-redact-tools`, which was broken. ([[!tails_ticket 19250]])

<h1 id="fixes">Fixed problems</h1>

We fixed 2 small usability issues in *Tor Connection*:

- Explain better how to use the *Unsafe Browser* to sign in to a local network. ([[!tails_ticket 19168]])

- Remove the *(easier)* and *(safer)* comments in the first screen. ([[!tails_ticket 19166]])

For more details, read our [[!tails_gitweb debian/changelog desc="changelog"]].

<h1 id="issues">Known issues</h1>

## Progress bar of Tor Connection getting stuck around 50%

When using a custom Tor `obfs4` bridge, the progress bar of *Tor Connection*
sometimes gets stuck halfway through and becomes extremely slow. ([[!tails_ticket 19173]])

To fix this, you can either:

- Close and reopen *Tor Connection* to speed up the initial connection.

- Try a different `obfs4` bridge.

  We believe that this issue should not happen with an up-to-date bridge
  running `obfs4proxy` version 0.0.12 or later.

See the list of [[long-standing issues|support/known_issues]].

## To upgrade your Tails USB stick and keep your Persistent Storage

  You can [[reduce the size of the download|doc/upgrade#reduce]] of future
  automatic upgrades by doing a manual upgrade to the latest version.

- If you cannot do an automatic upgrade or if Tails fails to start after an
  automatic upgrade, please try to do a [[manual upgrade|doc/upgrade/#manual]].
