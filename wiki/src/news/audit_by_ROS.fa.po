"In March 2023, [Radically Open Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity."
"com/) conducted a security audit on the major improvements that we released "
"in [[Tails 5.8|version_5.8]] (December 2022) on the Persistent Storage, the "
"Unsafe Browser, and the Wayland integration."

"To better protect our users, we addressed most of the security "
"vulnerabilities as soon as they were discovered and reported to us, without "
"waiting for the audit to be complete and public. We can now share with your "
"the [final report](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/uploads/"

"> ***Overall, the Tails operating system left a solid impression and addressed\n"
"> most of the concerns of an average user in need of anonymity.***\n"
">\n"
"> *This is particularly evident in the isolation of various components by the\n"
"> developers. For example, the configured AppArmor rules often prevented a\n"
"> significant impact of the found vulnerabilities. Shifting to Wayland was a\n"
"> good decision, as it provides more security by isolating individual GUI\n"
"> applications.*\n"
">\n"
"> *All in all, no serious vulnerabilities were found through the integration\n"
"> into Wayland. Unsafe Browser and Persistent Storage should now be less\n"
"> vulnerable to attack, as all vulnerabilities have been fixed.*\n"

"issue was fixed before the actual impact was assessed and so marked as "

"As good as the results of this audit are, they also serve as a reminder that "

"critical security vulnerabilities. Your best protection against all kinds of "
