"> ***Overall, the Tails operating system left a solid impression and "
"addressed\n"
"> most of the concerns of an average user in need of anonymity.***\n"
">\n"
"> *This is particularly evident in the isolation of various components by "
"the\n"
"> developers. For example, the configured AppArmor rules often prevented a\n"
"> significant impact of the found vulnerabilities. Shifting to Wayland was "
"a\n"
"> good decision, as it provides more security by isolating individual GUI\n"
"> applications.*\n"
">\n"
"> *All in all, no serious vulnerabilities were found through the "
"integration\n"
"> into Wayland. Unsafe Browser and Persistent Storage should now be less\n"
"> vulnerable to attack, as all vulnerabilities have been fixed.*\n"
