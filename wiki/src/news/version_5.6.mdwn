<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Update *Tor Browser* to [11.5.5](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-1155).

- Update the *Linux* kernel to 5.10.149. This should improve the support for newer
  hardware: graphics, Wi-Fi, and so on.

<h1 id="fixes">Fixed problems</h1>

- When a manual upgrade is required, Tails now always points to the release
  notes of the latest version, instead of pointing sometimes to a deprecated
  version. ([[!tails_ticket 17069]])

For more details, read our [[!tails_gitweb debian/changelog desc="changelog"]].
