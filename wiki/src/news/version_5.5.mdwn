<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Update *Thunderbird* to [102.3.0](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/102.3.0/releasenotes/).

  *Thunderbird* 102 is a major update with [many changes to the navigation,
folder icons, and address
book](https://blog.thunderbird.net/2022/06/thunderbird-102-released-a-serious-upgrade-to-your-communication/).

  *Thunderbird* 102 also includes important usability improvements to the
  OpenPGP feature. When composing an email, you can now see whether it will be
  encrypted or not. If encryption is impossible, a key assistant helps you
  solve key issues.

- Update *Tor Browser* to [11.5.4](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-1154).

- Update the *Linux* kernel to 5.10.140. This should improve the support for newer
  hardware: graphics, Wi-Fi, and so on.

- Make the `wget` command line utility use a different Tor circuit every time.
