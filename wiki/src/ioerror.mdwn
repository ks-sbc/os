      Error reading data from your Tails USB stick.
      Please visit https://tails.net/ioerror for troubleshooting.

      Error Reading Data from Tails USB Stick

      The hardware of your USB stick is probably failing.

      We recommend that you reinstall Tails on a different USB stick
      and recover the data from your Persistent Storage as soon as possible.

These alerts are displayed when Tails detects a problem reading or writing to
your USB stick. Most likely, these alerts mean that the hardware of your USB
stick is failing and might completely break soon.

You should stop using this USB stick for Tails and install a new one.

- If you don't have a Persistent Storage on this USB stick, we recommend that
  you [[reinstall Tails|install]] on a new USB stick.

- If you have a Persistent Storage on this USB stick, we recommend that you
  stop using this Tails immediately, reinstall Tails on a new USB stick, and
  recover the data from your Persistent Storage as soon as possible.

  To do so, follow our instructions on [[recovering the Persistent Storage from
  a broken Tails|doc/persistent_storage/recover]].
