In this newsletter, we share inspiring stories of Tails users around the world,
privacy tips, and the latest from our team with our supporters.

**$142&#8239;027, including 60 Ethereum.**

That's the aggregate of all your generous donations during our year-end fundraiser!

Thank you,
again, to our seasoned donors, and a very warm welcome to the Tails community
to our new donors. Your continuing support ensures that Tails
goes from strength to strength in our mission to offer the most secure,
private, and empowering ways to be online.

Unfortunately, 15% fewer people donated this year and we are trying to
figure out why.

Thankfully, we brought in some help! In February,
we hired our first Fundraising Director. Introducing bokonon:

# Investigating the spying of the Mexican army on feminists

Across the world from bokonon, we are drawing inspiration from the indigenous
resistance of Guacamaya, a cyber activist collective targeting extractive
industries and government agencies in Abya Yala (the original indigenous name
of the region between northern Colombia and Panama).

In September 2022, Guacamaya obtained and released 6 TB of data (over
4 million documents) revealing Mexico's Ministry of National Defense's
(Sedena) and the Mexican army's persecution of actors involved in progressive
political movements.

The documents have revealed so far that the Mexican army:

* Spy on [environmental
  activists](https://causanatura.org/periodismo-cn/con-pena-nieto-y-amlo-sedena-monitoreo-a-opositores-al-fracking-en-la-huasteca-de-san-luis-potosi)
* Spy on [journalists, human rights
  defenders](https://www.animalpolitico.com/sociedad/sedena-software-espia-periodistas-defensores-derechos-humanos)
* [Interfered in the Ayotzinapa
  case](https://contralacorrupcion.mx/la-secreta-operacion-limpieza-del-ejercito-en-el-caso-ayotzinapa/)
  by shielding the institution from civilian scrutiny
* Have fostered a culture of [covering up the sexual
  harassment](https://laotraopinion.com.mx/guacamaya-leaks-las-fiestas-privadas-de-la-sedena-con-abusos-sexuales/)
  of female officers
* Have [many ex-pilots working for the drug
  cartels](https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/guacamaya-leaks-revela-nexos-entre-9-expilotos-de-la-sedena-y-el-narco)

In March, **investigative journalists from [PODER](https://poderlatam.org/en/what-we-do/) and [Serendipia](https://serendipia.digital/) used Tails** to
comb through the data and unearth the [systematic espionage of feminists and LGBTQIA+
groups](https://nocallaronlasolas.serendipia.digital/) for over 50 years.

The investigation revealed the collection of very detailed personal information
and surveillance, including photos, home addresses, and phone numbers. In one of
the documents, feminists were deemed as much of a risk for
airport security as drug cartels...

These developments come at a time when Mexican lawmakers have approved an
extension of the Mexican armed forces' public security role until 2028. That's
quite the U-turn from López Obrador's decrial, before coming to power, of the
role that the Mexican armed forces were playing in resolving social problems.
This makes the work of groups like Guacamaya, PODER, and Serendipia and so many
other others even more crucial.

Part of what makes their work remarkable is the risks they undertake. Powerful,
authoritarian actors are not known for taking censure lying down. That's where
**Tails can help, by protecting journalists from malware in the data**.
PODER has also built a
guide on creating a [safe digital environment for investigative journalists](https://poderlatam.org/2023/03/cuidados-digitales-para-la-investigacion/).
They recommend using Tails for its anti-malware, anti-censorship, and
anti-surveillance properties.

# Major changes and lots of fixes

<img src="https://tails.net/doc/persistent_storage/creation.png"/>

Over the past 4 months, we released major changes in Tails to improve both
usability and security.

In [Tails 5.8](https://tails.net/news/version_5.8), we finally released
the new Persistent Storage and a hardened Tails thanks to Wayland.

* The new Persistent Storage doesn't require restarting after the creation or
  activation of new features. It will also make it easier for us to add new
  features in the future.

* Wayland brings more security in depth by making it harder for a compromised
  application in Tails to compromise or misuse another application. For
  example, Wayland made it safe to reactivate the Unsafe Browser by default.

But, these changes came with several issues in areas that were hard for us to
test in advance. We're very sorry about the trouble that these caused
some of our users.

Since then, we made it our top priority to fix as many of these issues as
possible. In [Tails 5.9](https://tails.net/news/version_5.9), [Tails
5.10](https://tails.net/news/version_5.10), and [Tails
5.11](https://tails.net/news/version_5.11), we fixed:

- Most of the issues on graphics cards by upgrading the Linux kernel to version 6.
- 6 integration issues of applications like *Kleopatra*, *KeePassXC*, *Feather
  Monero* with Wayland.
- 3 reliability and 3 usability issues in the new Persistent Storage.

In the coming months, our focus will be to keep solving reliability and
usability issues in the new Persistent Storage and the Tor Connection
assistant.
