At the end of every year, we ask our supporters and well-wishers to make a
contribution towards our mission. As we enter the last month of 2023, we are
[reflecting](https://tails.net/news/gift_of_privacy/) on a year in
which progressive, liberatory movements battled intense online surveillance
from powerful public and private actors alike.

Unfortunately, Tails' mission is more important now than ever before.

You are reading this because you have donated to Tails in the past. And you're
also reading this because we'd love [your renewed and continued
support](https://tails.net/donate/) for Tails to scale greater
heights in 2024!

Improvements to the Persistent Storage
======================================

### External security audit

In March 2023, we partnered with [Radically Open
Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/) to conduct a comprehensive
pen-test of our major improvements for Persistent Storage, Unsafe Browser, and
the Wayland integration in [Tails 5.8](https://tails.net/news/version_5.8/). Tails performed exceptionally well in the
test, demonstrating our dedication to robust security measures. You can find
the full results [here](https://tails.net/news/audit_by_ROS/).

### Enhanced backup

[Tails 5.14](https://tails.net/news/version_5.14/) introduced a new and improved backup method for the Persistent Storage.
Users can now create a complete backup of their Persistent Storage by cloning
it to a full backup Tails installation. This ensures that your valuable data is
not lost in case of accidental deletion or hardware failure.

### Data deletion

In case you'd like to delete some data from your Persistent Storage, [Tails 5.12](https://tails.net/news/version_5.12) and later
provides a straightforward way. Simply click the **Delete Data** button after
disabling a Persistent Storage feature to erase the corresponding
data.

### Stronger encryption

In [Tails 5.14](https://tails.net/news/version_5.14/), we adopted LUKS2 with Argon2id as the default encryption algorithm for all new Persistent Storage and LUKS-encrypted volumes. This upgrade provides significantly stronger protection against brute-force attacks
compared to the previous PBKDF2 algorithm.

Our likely next big feature
===========================

<img src="https://tails.net/newsletter/2023-11/walkie-talkie.png" alt=""/>

In our last newsletter, we asked for your help to shape the future of Tails in
the form of a survey about upcoming features.

We received 105 answers from Tails supporters like you. We were thrilled to see
your interest in helping us set our priorities!

In parallel, we interviewed 14 journalists, activists, and digital
security trainers who use Tails around the world. We talked to researchers who
work on high-stakes investigations like [Amnesty
International](https://www.amnesty.org/) and [OCCRP](https://www.occrp.org/),
digital security trainers who support human rights defenders in Afghanistan,
Syria, and Uganda, environmental activists from [Les Soul√®vements de la
Terre](https://lessoulevementsdelaterre.org/) who are criminalized by their
government, organizations that create safe whistleblowing platforms like [Secure
Drop](https://securedrop.org/) and [MexicoLeaks](https://mexicoleaks.mx/),
independent journalists who investigate state surveillance, online crime,
sexual violence, and so on.

**One tool stood out as the top priority for our users:
[Signal](https://signal.org/).**

Signal in Tails would help journalists, activists, and whistleblowers communicate more easily with their collaborators but also handle hazardous material and sensitive communications more safely.

The fact that Signal requires a phone number to register is a major concern for
people in need of anonymity like whistleblowers and activists. But many of them
already use Signal anyway as it's the best trade-off between security,
usability, and popularity. Soon, the upcoming [*username feature*](https://community.signalusers.org/t/public-username-testing-staging-environment/56866)
of Signal will allow sharing usernames instead of phone numbers.

On top of Signal, we'll keep thinking about
alternatives for those who really can't afford to register with a phone number.

**We identified including VPN in Tails as our next priority.**

Having another browser that uses a VPN instead of Tor would also be very useful
in Tails as a way of working around the limitations of the Tor network. VPNs
have higher speed and lower latency, are not blocked by websites as much as Tor is,
support videoconferencing tools, have fewer CAPTCHAs, and allow choosing your
exit country.

- We stand in solidarity with the resistance of Palestinians against Israeli
  apartheid, colonial theft of lands, and genocidal violence. Violent and
  necropolitical technologies deployed by the global state-military complex
  instrumentalize Israel's occupation of Palestine. [Read about Elbit
  Systems](https://www.wrmea.org/2019-august-september/elbit-systems-bringing-israeli-apartheid-to-the-u.s.-mexican-border.html),

  to [Mexico](https://theintercept.com/2019/08/25/border-patrol-israel-elbit-surveillance/).

- The Internet is shaped by many competing forces, but none as brutish as those
  wielded by authoritarian governments. The Indian government has taken it upon
  itself to develop a playbook for repressive regimes. Here's a [series of
  stories](https://www.dailydot.com/modis-internet/) showcasing how pervasive
  this power is. Nineteen Eighty-Four, hold my beer.

- In our last newsletter, we wrote about the Online Safety Bill (OSB) in the
  United Kingdom. As was the case with the OSB, and is with many other policy
  proposals, they all seek to weaken encryption to protect children from
  exploitation and abuse online. Wondering who benefits from this narrative, I
  found an answer

  Spoiler: it's not the children.
