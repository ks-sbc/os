In this newsletter, we share with our supporters our latest news, inspiring
stories of Tails users around the world, and privacy tips.

Protecting abortion activists in Brazil
=======================================

<img src="https://tails.net/contribute/how/user_experience/interviews/gabriela.jpg" link="no" alt="Afro-Brazilian handmade jewelry that hides a Tails USB stick"/>

In August, we traveled to Brazil to learn how to improve Tails for the many
people fighting for social change there. We trained 34 people on Tails:
activists, journalists, feminists, and human rights defenders.

We also met Gabriela, a feminist hacker who has been training low-income women
from the Bahia region on using Tails. We are sharing Gabriela's story with you a
few days before making it public on our website.

Gabriela introduced these women to Tails by mixing up local culture and privacy
technology and presenting Tails as a *patu√°*, a type of Brazilian protection
amulet that hides the USB stick in jewelry.

These women didn't have computers of their own and used the computers at work
or in university or the computers of their husbands and boyfriends. Tails is
useful for them to work on reproductive rights but also to protect their
personal data from intrusive boyfriends.

Women working on reproductive rights understand very easily the importance of
privacy tools like Tails because a single mistake can compromise an entire
organization and get them in trouble with the police.

Some of them had their home raided by the police after being denounced for
their work on abortion. All the information about their patients was not in
their phones, but in their Tails amulet, and the police couldn't find any
evidence about their work.

As the access to safe abortion continues to be very problematic in too many
countries around the world, we are very interested in getting in touch with
more reproductive rights activists who are already using Tails or want to learn
how to use it.

What we achieved together in 2022
=================================

<img src="https://tails.net/news/test_5.8-beta1/features.png" link="no" alt=""/>

When digital security tools are too complicated to use, people make mistakes
that compromise their security or simply give up and fall back on more
dangerous practices.

Because journalists and whistleblowers use Tails to expose abuse of power and
activists use Tails to defend human rights and our planet, the more people use
Tails, the better we are all protected.

In 2022, we focused on making it easier to install Tails and improving many
existing features, instead of adding new features. Here are some highlights.

* We made 2 big changes to PGP tools in Tails:

  - We added *Kleopatra*, a swiss army knife for all things PGP.

  - We updated *Thunderbird* to 102, which includes major usability
    improvements to the OpenPGP feature.

* We fixed 28 usability issues on *Tor Connection* that we discovered during
  usability tests in France and Brazil with people who were new to Tails.

* We added *Metadata Cleaner*, a new tool to clean metadata from your files.

* We will release a complete redesign of the *Persistent Storage* and a better
  *Unsafe Browser* in Tails 5.8 (December 20).

Bridge connection getting stuck
===============================

When using a custom Tor obfs4 bridge, the progress bar of *Tor Connection*
sometimes gets stuck halfway through and becomes extremely slow.

<img src="https://tails.net/doc/anonymous_internet/tor/troubleshoot/stuck.png" alt=""/>

To fix this, you can either:

- Close and reopen *Tor Connection* to speed up the initial connection.

- Try a different obfs4 bridge.

  This issue only affects outdated obfs4 bridges and does not happen with obfs4
  bridges that run version 0.0.12 or later.

  Here is an exclusive bridge that works fine with Tails. You'll be able to
  scan the QR code in the upcoming Tails 5.8 (December 20).

Help Tails face global economic hardship
========================================

As global recession is creeping up, big tech companies are going through
massive layoffs, and cryptocurrency markets collapse, small tools like Tails
that rely on independent donations like yours also suffer.

During the first month of our donation campaign, we received 30% fewer
donations than in 2021. **We are missing at least 350 more donations.**

In 2020&ndash;2022, donations from passionate people like you represented 76%
of our income. This is incredible for a project like Tails which is downloaded
for free millions of times each year by anonymous users. But it also makes us
vulnerable to such global economic events.

- Our friends at OONI published a very detailed technical report on the
  [Internet shutdown and censorship events that emerged in
  Iran](https://ooni.org/post/2022-iran-technical-multistakeholder-report/)
  following the death of Mahsa Amini. OONI also [turned 10 this
  week](https://ooni.org/post/highlights-10-years-of-ooni/). Happy birthday!

  WIRED studies how [Iran's Internet blackouts are part of a global
  menace](https://www.wired.com/story/iran-mahsa-amini-internet-shutdown/) as
  *repressive regimes are teaching each other how to control protesters' web
  access with increasingly surgical precision*.

- In [China is gaining control of the world's data as the US stands
  by](https://www.codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/data-trafficking-china-us-tiktok/),
  Aynne Kokas analyzes how *Chinese firms and the Chinese government gather
  data on US citizens for political and commercial gain, putting US national
  security at risk*.

- Freedom House published their year [Freedom on the
  Net](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2022/countering-authoritarian-overhaul-internet)
  report, observing that *at home and on the international stage,
  authoritarians are on a campaign to divide the open internet into a patchwork
  of repressive enclaves.*

- In [An information theoretic model of privacy and security
  metrics](https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/an-information-theoretic-model-of-privacy-and-security-metrics/),
  the always-excellent Bill Budington from the EFF explains the concept of
  entropy and its implication on browser fingerprinting and password safety in
  accessible terms.
