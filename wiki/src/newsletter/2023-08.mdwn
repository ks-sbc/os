# Help us shape the future of Tails!

<img src="https://tails.net/newsletter/2023-08/workshop.jpg" alt=""/>

In 2021&ndash;2023, we focused on improving the usability of some core features of
Tails. We redesigned the [Tor Connection](https://tails.net/news/version_4.20)
to make it easier to circumvent censorship and the [Persistent
Storage](https://tails.net/news/version_5.8) to make it easier to store
encrypted data in Tails.

What shall we work on next?

We have identified the need for better communication tools as a priority
for our users. We are considering 2 main options:

- Make it possible to use a VPN instead of Tor in some cases
- Add support for better messaging applications

In the coming months, we will do some research to understand the needs of our
users and decide which of these features to work on first.

As a start, we wanted your opinion as supporters of Tails. Help us decide by
answering this 5-minute survey.

# Encryption under attack worldwide

French law enforcement is now allowed to spy on suspects by [remotely activating
the camera, microphone, and GPS](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2023/07/06/france-set-to-allow-police-to-spy-through-phones_6044269_7.html) of their electronic devices. It’s not clear how they plan to execute this, but malware like [[!wikipedia Pegasus_(spyware) desc="Pegasus"]] could do the trick.

The Justice Minister has been adamant that
“*we're far away from the totalitarianism of 1984*” George Orwell's novel about a society under total surveillance.
And of course, the
lawmakers were quick to exempt themselves from the invasive law.

The French authorities aren't alone in wanting backdoors in encrypted communications. On
the other side of the English Channel, lawmakers with the United Kingdom are
about to [mandate backdoors in all end-to-end encrypted messaging systems](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/07/uk-government-very-close-eroding-encryption-worldwide) and erode encryption worldwide in the [Online Safety Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3137/publications). This perpetual wiretap
will, allegedly, make the United Kingdom “[*the safest place in the world to be
online while defending free
expression*](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-bill-supporting-documents)”.

In a [document from the European Council](https://www.wired.com/story/europe-break-encryption-leaked-document-csa-law/) leaked to WIRED, a majority of
EU countries are in favor of some form of scanning of encrypted messages. Spain
has the most extreme position and proposes to “*legislatively prevent EU-based
service providers from implementing end-to-end encryption*”.

In the USA, the return of the [EARN IT
Act](https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/2022/internet-impact-brief-how-the-us-earn-it-act-threatens-security-confidentiality-and-safety-online/)
also threatens the possibility for companies to provide end-to-end encryption.

# Amidst repression in France, using Tails is not a crime

<img src="https://tails.net/newsletter/2023-08/encryption.png" alt=""/>

Tails, together with another 130 people and
organizations, signed a [call to defend our right to
encryption](https://www.laquadrature.net/2023/06/15/tribune-attaches-aux-libertes-fondamentales-dans-lespace-numerique-nous-defendons-le-droit-au-chiffrement-de-nos-communications/),
written by La Quadrature du Net.

Digital surveillance of dissenting socio-political movements
has been intensifying in France for years.
[Environmental activists](https://lessoulevementsdelaterre.org/blog/un-traceur-gps-retrouve-sous-le-vehicule-du-porte-parolede-bassines-non-merci)
are being surveilled with military-grade equipment and Emmanuel Macron [blames social media for the uprising](https://www.laquadrature.net/2023/07/28/revoltes-et-reseaux-sociaux-le-retour-du-coupable-ideal/) that followed the racist killing of a 17-year-old by the police.

As if that wasn’t enough,
the mere use of privacy-preserving tools like Tor and [Tails is being treated as
evidence of criminal behavior](https://www.laquadrature.net/en/2023/06/05/criminalization-of-encryption-the-8-december-case/) to muzzle dissenting political groups. In the
French senate, the Minister of Interior
begged for
the power to hack into the phones of demonstrators who use Signal,
WhatsApp, or Telegram. In this “8 December” case, the suspects’ use of Tails,
and apparent distrust of GAFAM were used to support an already nebulous case.

In 2009, in a similar wave of repression, we created Tails precisely to avoid activists getting
in trouble merely because of how they used computers.

In 2023, not much has changed. It’s saddening and enraging that digital privacy
and safety are rapidly getting out of reach. Tails’s mission as important now,
if not more, as it was 15 years ago.

# Welcome to tails.net

Tails has a cool, new domain: <a href="https://tails.net/">`tails.net`</a>.

After 14 years of using a subdomain of `boum.org` , we finally found a new home
that will be easier for everybody to remember and type. Tails
will become easier to find by the people who need it the most.

The `tails.boum.org` domain will continue working for some time.

Thank you to
`boum.org`, for supporting us all these years!

# What we’re reading

* In India, the state of [Manipur has spiraled into intense communal and ethnic
  conflict](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/21/manipur-india-why-is-there-conflict-and-how-is-the-government-responding). A 3-month internet shutdown led to the silencing of the minority Kuki
  community. Internet access was permitted for people with broadband connections
  who undertook to only use static IP and not use any VPNs. [Mobile internet
  remains inaccessible](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/manipur-partially-withdraws-ban-on-broadband-mobile-internet-remains-suspended/article67119748.ece) and is the dominant way to access the internet for the
  Kuki community. The dystopian [undertaking](https://i.redd.it/g329xvb6ueeb1.jpg)
  makes for a <strike>fun</strike> chilling read.

* In [Surveillance: You can know too much](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jun/17/surveillance.database),
  Cory Doctorow decries the intrusive data
  collection tendencies of law enforcement around the world. A seasoned advocate
  of individuals’ privacy rights and critic of surveillance capitalism, he argues
  that law enforcement doesn't know what to do with the data it already has. As
  countries around the world lust after collecting more and more data, this
  article is both prescient and timeless.

* The IETF, the international organization responsible for all the standards
  that make the Internet work, has recently published a new standard for the
  end-to-end encryption of messages for 2 people or more. [MSL (Messaging Layer
  Security)](https://blog.phnx.im/rfc-9420-mls/) will make it easier and safer
  to add end-to-end encryption to more Internet applications.

* The Tor project is calling for more *obfs4* bridges to [help people in
  Turkmenistan circumvent
  censorship](https://forum.torproject.org/t/tor-relays-help-turkmens-to-bypass-internet-censorship-run-an-obfs4-bridge/7002).
  If you have access to an IP address that hasn't run a Tor bridge yet, you can
  help thousands of people in Turkmenistan connect to the Internet.
