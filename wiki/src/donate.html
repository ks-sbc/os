      <p><b>[[Tails has merged with the Tor Project|news/tails_tor]]</b></p>

      <p>From now on, all new donations to the Tor Project will support the whole
      suite of tools developed by the Tor Project, including Tails, the Tor
      network, and Tor Browser.</p>

      <p>You may hear from fundraising staff from Tails or the Tor Project as we
      make the transition. We are excited about this merger and the
      opportunity to put more resources towards the development of Tails!</p>

      <p>Thank you for supporting us through this process.</p>

  <h1>Tails is their strongest protection</h1>

  <p>At Tails, we build a liberating operating system that puts people in control
  of their digital lives.</p>

  <p>In 2023, Tails touched the lives of approximately 25&#8239;000 individuals
  daily, and will surpass a staggering 10 million uses. Over the years, Tails has
  become an invaluable ally for those on the front lines of truth-seeking and
  progressive political advocacy:</p>

  <ul>

    <li><p><b>Investigative journalists</b> have used Tails to securely unearth
    corruption and wrongdoing, without fear of reprisal. For example,
    journalists from PODER and Serendipia used Tails to investigate the
    systematic espionage of feminists and LGBTQIA+ groups by the Mexican
    army.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Activists</b> have used Tails to organize and communicate with
    each other, even in repressive regimes. For example, reproductive rights
    activists in Brazil have used Tails to protect their work and personal data
    from intrusive law enforcement and boyfriends alike.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Whistleblowers</b> have used Tails to expose wrongdoing without
    compromising their identities or endangering their sources. For example,
    Edward Snowden and his collaborators used Tails to expose the massive
    global surveillance programs orchestrated by the NSA and the Five Eyes
    intelligence alliance.</p></li>

  </ul>

  <p>Tails is nonprofit, and runs on a relatively small budget. We have
  punched above our weight thanks to your support, and we continue to need your
  support every year.</p>

  <p>By donating to Tails, you can help us to continue developing and improving
  Tails, and to make it more accessible to people who need it most.</p>
