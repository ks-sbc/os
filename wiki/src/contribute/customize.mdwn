This page documents a bit how to [[contribute/build]] a custom system
based on Tails.

<div class="caution">

<p>The resulting system will effectively be a fork of
Tails, that only you can support: do not expect any help from us about
it.</p>

<p>Please consider [[having your changes merged|contribute/how/code]]
into Tails instead.</p>

# Settings specific to Tails

The settings that can be customized can be found in `config/variables`.

# Debian Live settings

Tails is based on Debian Live.
Nearly everything can thus be customized. To learn how to do so, refer
to the Debian Live [manual](https://live-team.pages.debian.net/live-manual/)
and
[wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/).

# $HOME

Tails default user's `$HOME` directory is created at runtime from
`/etc/skel/`. One may want to build an image including a modified
version of it. There are multiple ways to do so:

1. edit the content of `config/chroot_local-includes/etc/skel/`
2. dropping shell scripts in `config/chroot_local-hooks/` or
   `config/chroot_local-includes/lib/live/config/`
   to modify `/home/amnesia` in a program-driven way
   (`gconftool`, etc.)
