# Talk at events

You can talk about Tails at various events, e.g. a local Linux User
Group, a group of domestic violence survivors, a security conference.
It all depends on who you happen to meet, what they are interested in,
and what you feel comfortable talking about. Do not hesitate asking
for advice or review of your material.
