# How to join the Chinese translation team?

New contributors should first subscribe to the [[mailing list for
translators|https://www.autistici.org/mailman/listinfo/tails-l10n/]] and
introduce themselves to the Chinese team on the list.

We currently work in both Simplified and Traditional Chinese and use
`opencc` to convert our work between the two writing systems.
