Currently there is no fixed team of German translators.

# Glossaries used by the German translation team

We try to follow the [GNOME Guidelines](https://wiki.gnome.org/de/Uebersetzung)
and their glossaries:

* <https://wiki.gnome.org/de/StandardUebersetzungen>
* <https://wiki.gnome.org/de/Uebersetzung/Dokumentationen>

For words not in these lists it is helpful to see
how they are translated (or not translated) in Wikipedia.

Often, we simply discuss on the [[mailing list for
translators|https://www.autistici.org/mailman/listinfo/tails-l10n/]] if
unsure which term applies best.
