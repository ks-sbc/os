[[!meta title="About Javascript on our website"]]

We use JavaScript to the minimum while always ensuring graceful
degradation.

Arguments against using JavaScript:

  - JavaScript can be dangerous for security and privacy. Tor Browser is
    supposed to block all JavaScript that might harm anonymity.
    But some of the JavaScript allowed by Tor Browser can still be dangerous.

  - An important part of our audience wants to be careful about
    JavaScript, for the reason mentioned above, and might disable it
    fully. To support this use case, we include the NoScript extension.
    So, to be coherent with this, every part of our website must be
    functional without JavaScript. This also ensures compatibility with
    all the levels of the security slider of Tor Browser ([[!tor_bug
    9387]]).

Arguments in favor of using JavaScript:

  - We already use JavaScript on our website, like for the [[JavaScript
    download verification|contribute/design/download_verification]].

  - JavaScript might allow us to present better our information to some
    users and improve the experience of navigating on our website.
    But using it to save us a bit of work or look cool might
    not be a good enough reason.
