# Kernel command line options

 - `early_patch`: see [[contribute/build/early-patch]]

 - `login`: skip the greeter, using the default options

 - `unlock=<password>`: automatically unlock the Persistent Storage

 - `rootpw=<password>` set the root password (not the amnesia password)

 - `break=init` stop boot before starting the init and give you a shell. Useful for small customizations that
   must be done before boot.
   If you need to do the same thing over and over, consider using [[contribute/build/early-patch]] instead

# Refresh patches

Sometimes, Tails FTBFS because of problems applying patches. Here is how you could fix that:

```sh
export TAILS_BUILD_OPTIONS="${TAILS_BUILD_OPTIONS:-} rescue"
rake build
rake vm:ssh
export PATCHING_FILE='/path/to/file/'
sudo PATCHING_FILE="${PATCHING_FILE}" chroot "$(ls /tmp/tails-build.* -dt|head -n1)/chroot/"
```

Set `PATCHING_FILE` to the file Tails is trying to patch. For example, it could be `/usr/share/mozilla/extensions/{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}/uBlock0@raymondhill.net/js/background.js`

```sh
cp "${PATCHING_FILE}.orig" "${PATCHING_FILE}"
sensible-editor "${PATCHING_FILE}"
diff -u "${PATCHING_FILE}.orig" "${PATCHING_FILE}"
```

copy-paste the output into `config/chroot-local_includes${PATCHING_FILE}`

Edit the patch, removing `.orig` from the first line:

```sh
sensible-editor "config/chroot-local_includes${PATCHING_FILE}"
git add "config/chroot-local_includes${PATCHING_FILE}"
```

# Run iso from commandline

To run an ISO directly without clicking through virt-manager:

```sh
kvm -m 2048 -cdrom <ISO NAME>.iso
```

you can even share a directoy with the client system:

```sh
kvm -m 2048 -virtfs local,path=/path/to/tails-git-dir,security_model=passthrough,mount_tag=src --cdrom /path/to/tails.iso
```

By passing through the Tails Git directory, the `early_patch` kernel command-line option can be used (see  [[contribute/build/early-patch]]). To mount the directory manually in the VM (after setting an admin password):

```sh
sudo mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio src /mnt/
```
