# Firewall configuration

All incoming and outgoing connections are dropped. Certain local
(loopback) services that use IPv6 are allowed on a case-by-case basis.

# IPv6 address generation

Historically IPv6 used the EUI-64 method for address generation, which
leaks your MAC address. To prevent this, NetworkManager is configured
to use the IPv6 Privacy Extensions for SLAAC (see RFC below) for IPv6
address generation, which ensures completely random addresses (except
the network prefix obtained from the local router).

These addresses are regenerated every 24 hour period (or on reboot, of
course) but old addresses are kept in addition to the regenerated one
until their last connections terminate. This is just the default
behavior of this option in Linux, we are not interested in this
property and just let it remain as-is.
