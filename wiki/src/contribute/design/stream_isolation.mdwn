[[!meta title="Tor stream isolation"]]

Tails implements basic Tor stream isolation, using functionality
described in
[Tor proposal 171](https://spec.torproject.org/proposals/171-separate-streams.html).

Special needs
=============

Tails-specific applications
---------------------------

Tails-specific applications use a dedicated `SocksPort`, so that they
don't help trivial correlating of other kinds of network traffic with
Tails:

* incremental updates
* htpdate
* security check
* WhisperBack

Web Browser
-----------

Tor Browser implements [fine-grained stream isolation](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/3455) on its own. We configure it to use a dedicated SOCKS port
with the options needed for that feature.

Destination address/port -based circuit isolation
-------------------------------------------------

Do we want to use `IsolateDestAddr` and/or `IsolateDestPort`?

Using these settings may help protecting against traffic correlation.
However:

* These settings are likely to have a performance impact on
  applications that connect to many remote hosts.

* These settings probably put more load on the network. On the other
  hand, the Tor people probably are happy with people using it given
  they have added the option in the first place. We will anyway ask
  them to review our proposed configuration with network load in mind
  before we ship it to the masses.

For performance reasons, we will start with *not* using
`IsolateDestAddr`/`IsolateDestPort` for the Tor Browser: nowadays,
loading a mere web page often requires fetching resources from a dozen
or more remote sources. (Also, it looks like the use of
`IsolateDestAddr` in a modern web browser may create very uncommon
HTTP behaviour patterns, that could ease fingerprinting.)

Consider Pidgin with several accounts configured for different
identities. If you connect with all of the accounts at the same time,
they'll all get the same circuit, so the identities can be correlated.
While Tails does not formally support using multiple contextual
identities at the same time, Pidgin generally opens very few network
connections, so the performance impact of using `IsolateDestAddr`
should be small. Given how cheap it is, it looks like it is worth
having Pidgin use a (not necessarily dedicated) `SocksPort` that has
`IsolateDestAddr` and `IsolateDestPort` enabled.

For the same reason, we actually want to enable `IsolateDestAddr` and
`IsolateDestPort` for the `SocksPort` used by most applications,
unless we tell them otherwise. It may break POP-before-SMTP
in Thunderbird.

Implementation
==============

A few SOCKS ports are configured
in [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/tor/torrc]]:

* default system-wide `SocksPort` (9050): `IsolateDestAddr` and
  `IsolateDestPort` enabled

* dedicated `SocksPort` for other Tails-specific applications (9062):
  `IsolateDestAddr` and `IsolateDestPort` enabled

* dedicated `SocksPort` (9063) used by the *Upgrader* to download IUKs with
  `tails-iuk-get-target-file`: we disable isolation flags so there's at least
  a chance that the circuit used to connect to Mirrorbits is reused for the
  actual download, thus benefiting from the fact Mirrorbits uses GeoIP to select
  the mirror.

* dedicated `SocksPort` for web browser (still 9050, but on a veth
  dedicated to web browser's netns): no stream
  isolation options

* no specific isolation options for the `TransPort` ([[!tails_ticket 6378]])

Applications are configured to use the right SOCKS port:

- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tor-browser-prefs.js]]
- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/lib/systemd/system/htpdate.service]]
- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/bin/tails-security-check]]
- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/bin/thunderbird]]
