[[!meta title="Security audits and advisories"]]

[[!toc levels=3]]

Since Tails is based on Debian, it takes advantage of all the work done by the
Debian security team. As quoted from <https://www.debian.org/security/>:

> Debian takes security very seriously. We handle all security
problems brought to our attention and ensure that they are corrected within a
reasonable timeframe. Many advisories are coordinated with other free software
vendors and are published the same day a vulnerability is made public and we
also have a Security Audit team that reviews the archive looking for new or
unfixed security bugs.

> Experience has shown that "security through obscurity" does
not work. Public disclosure allows for more rapid and better solutions to
security problems. In that vein, this page addresses Debian's status with
respect to various known security vulnerabilities, which could potentially affect
Debian.
