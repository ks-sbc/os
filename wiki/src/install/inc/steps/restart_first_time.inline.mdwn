<p>Starting the computer using a Boot Menu key can be faster than
starting the computer on Windows first and then on Tails. We

regularly.</p>

<p>Apple does not prioritize collaborating with Free Software projects. Their

better with Linux.</p>

1. One to two minutes after the Boot Loader and the loading screen, the Welcome Screen appears.

   <div class="bug windows linux mac upgrade-tails">

   <p>If the following message about partitioning errors appears in the Welcome
   Screen, please start again from step 2: <a href="#verify">Verify your

   <p class="code">Errors were detected in the partitioning of your Tails USB stick.</p>

   <p>If the error persists, reinstall on a new USB stick.</p>

   <p>If you are in a place where counterfeit electronics are common, we
   recommend that you buy your USB stick from an international supermarket
   chain, which should have a more reliable supply chain.</p>

1. In the Welcome Screen, select your language and
   keyboard layout in the <b>Language and Formats</b> section.
   Click <b>Start Tails</b>.

   <div class="bug mac upgrade-mac">
   <p>If your keyboard or touchpad doesn't work, try using a USB keyboard or mouse.</p>
