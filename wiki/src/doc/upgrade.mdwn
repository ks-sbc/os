[[!meta title="Upgrading a Tails USB stick"]]

Tails includes an automatic mechanism to upgrade a USB stick to
the latest version of Tails. When an automatic upgrade is performed, only an
*upgrade package* is downloaded. The upgrade package contains all the changes
made to Tails since Tails was first installed or was last manually upgraded.

In some cases, it is impossible to do an **automatic upgrade**
and you might have to do a **manual upgrade**. This page describes both techniques.

<div class="note">

<p>Your Persistent Storage will be preserved by both automatic and
manual upgrades.</p>

If you use Tails from a DVD, you need to [[burn a new DVD|install/dvd]].

<h1 id="check-version">Checking which version of Tails you are currently running</h1>

To check which version of Tails you are currently running, choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Tails</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">About Tails</span></span>.

In the **About Tails** utility, you can click **Check for Upgrades** to check
whether a new version of Tails is available. This check is also done
automatically every time you start Tails and connect to the Tor network.

<h1 id="automatic">Automatic upgrade using <i>Tails Upgrader</i></h1>

After starting Tails and connecting to Tor, <span class="application">Tails
Upgrader</span> automatically checks if upgrades are available and then
proposes you to upgrade your USB stick. The upgrades are checked for and downloaded
through Tor.

The advantages of automatic upgrades are the following:

- You only need a single Tails USB stick. The upgrade is done on the fly from a
  running Tails. After upgrading, you can restart and use the new version.

- The upgrade is much smaller to download than a full USB image.

- The upgrade mechanism includes cryptographic verification of the upgrade.
  You don't have to verify the USB image yourself anymore.

Requirements:

- A Tails USB stick

- An Internet connection

After connecting to Tor, if an upgrade is available, a dialog appears and
proposes you to upgrade your USB stick.

If you decide to do the upgrade, click on <span
class="guilabel">Upgrade now</span>,
and follow the assistant through the upgrade process.

<div class="tip">

<p>If you cannot upgrade at startup (for example, if you have no network
connection by then), you can start <span class="application">Tails
Upgrader</span> later by opening a terminal and executing the following
command:</p>

<pre>tails-upgrade-frontend-wrapper</pre>

</div>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

- If an error occurs while installing the upgrade, *Tails Upgrader* asks you to visit:

  [[file:///usr/share/doc/tails/website/doc/upgrade/error/install.en.html|upgrade/error/install]]

- If another error occur while upgrading or if your Tails USB stick fails to
  start after an automatic upgrade, we recommend that you do a manual upgrade
  instead. See below.

<h1 id="manual">Manual upgrade using <i>Tails Cloner</i></h1>

It might not always be possible to do an automatic upgrade as described [[above|upgrade#automatic]].
For example, when:

- No automatic upgrade is available from our website for this version.

- The automatic upgrade is impossible for technical reasons (not enough
  memory, not enough free space on the USB stick, and so on). For example, if you
  get the following error message:

       there is not enough free space on the Tails system partition

- The automatic upgrade failed and you need to repair a Tails USB stick.

- You want to upgrade by cloning from another Tails USB stick which is
  already up-to-date, for example, when working offline or with a slow
  Internet connection.

After connecting to Tor, a dialog informs you if you have to
upgrade your USB stick using <span class="application">Tails Cloner</span>
to a newer version of Tails.

<div class="tip">

<p>You can also do a manual upgrade to reduce the size of future automatic
upgrades.</p>

<p>When doing automatic upgrades, the size of the download increases over time.
If you do a manual upgrade, the size of future automatic upgrades will become
smaller again.</p>

<p>We estimated that, to actually reduce the
overall download size, it's only worth it to do 1 manual upgrade every year if
you apply all upgrades of Tails.</p>

</div>

To do a manual upgrade, you can either:

- [[Download and upgrade|doc/upgrade/#download]] (below)

- [[Upgrade by cloning from another Tails|doc/upgrade/#clone]] (below)

- [[Burn a new Tails DVD|install/dvd]]

<h2 id="download">Download and upgrade</h2>

You need:

- Your Tails USB stick

- Another empty USB stick <small>(at least 8 GB)</small>&nbsp;[[!toggle id="why_extra" text="Why?"]]

- ½ hour to download Tails (<small class="remove-extra-space">[[!inline pages="inc/stable_amd64_iso_size" raw="yes" sort="age"]]</small>)

- ½ hour to upgrade

[[!toggleable id="why_extra" text="""
<span class="hide">[[!toggle id="why_extra" text=""]]</span>
<p>It is currently impossible to manually upgrade a Tails USB stick
while running from itself. This scenario requires creating an
intermediary Tails on another USB stick, from which to upgrade your
Tails.</p>

See our instructions on how to do a manual upgrade by:

- [[Downloading and upgrading from your Tails|upgrade/tails]] (more secure)

- [[Downloading and upgrading from Windows|upgrade/windows]] (more convenient)

- [[Downloading and upgrading from macOS|upgrade/mac]] (more convenient)

- [[Downloading and upgrading from Linux|upgrade/linux]] (more convenient)

<div class="caution">

<p>Downloading and upgrading from Windows might be less secure if your
Windows has viruses. But, it might be more convenient and faster.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="clone">Upgrade by cloning from another Tails</h2>

If you know someone you trust who already did the upgrade, you can
upgrade your Tails by cloning from their Tails.

You need:

- Your Tails USB stick

- Another up-to-date Tails (USB stick or DVD)

- ¼ hour to upgrade

See our instructions on how to do a manual upgrade by:

- [[Cloning from another Tails|upgrade/clone]]
