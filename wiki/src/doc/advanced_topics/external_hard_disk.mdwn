[[!meta title="Starting Tails from an external hard disk or problematic USB stick"]]

When starting Tails from an external hard disk or problematic USB stick,
Tails might return the following error message:

<p class="code">Unable to find a medium containing a live file system</p>

In such cases, choose the **External Hard Disk** entry if it appears in
the Boot Loader.

If the **External Hard Disk** entry does not appear in the Boot Loader,
then remove the `live-media=removable`
boot option. To do so, see our instructions on [[modifying the boot options using
the Boot Loader|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]].

<div class="caution">

<p>Choosing the <b>External Hard Disk</b> entry in the Boot Loader or removing
the <code>live-media=removable</code> boot
option might be dangerous. If an adversary had access to the computer
and installed a malicious Tails on the internal hard disk, the computer
might start on the malicious Tails instead of on the USB stick.</p>
