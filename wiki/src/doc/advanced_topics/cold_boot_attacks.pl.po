"While using a computer, all the data manipulated is written temporarily in "
"[[!wikipedia Random-access_memory desc=\"RAM\"]]: texts, saved files, but "
"also passwords and encryption keys. The more recent the activity, the more "
"likely it is for the data to still be in RAM."

"After a computer is powered off, the data in RAM disappears rapidly, but it "
"can remain in RAM up to several minutes after shutdown. An attacker having "
"access to a computer before the data in RAM disappears completely could "

"This can be achieved using a technique called [[!wikipedia cold boot "
"attack]]. To prevent such attacks, the data in RAM is overwritten by random "
"data when you shut down Tails."

"Moreover, an attacker having physical access to the computer *while Tails is "
"running* can recover data from RAM as well. To avoid that, learn the "
"different methods to [[shutdown Tails|doc/first_steps/shutdown]] rapidly."
