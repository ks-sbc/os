[[!meta title="virt-manager"]]

[*virt-manager*](http://virt-manager.org/) is a Free Software
virtualization solution for Linux. *virt-manager* has a more complex
interface than *GNOME Boxes* but it also has a more
complete set of features.

Terminology
===========

*virt-manager* is based on a set of lower level virtualization tools,
going from the user interface to the hardware interactions with the
processor. This terminology is a bit confusing and other documentation
might mention the following tools:

- *KVM* is the module of the Linux kernel that interacts with the
  virtualization features of the processor.

- *QEMU* is the virtualization software that emulates virtual
  processors and peripherals based on *KVM* and that starts and stops
  virtual machines.

- *libvirt* is a library that allows *virt-manager* to interact with
  the virtualization capabilities provided by *QEMU*.

- *SPICE* is a protocol that allows to visualize the desktop of
  virtual machines.

- *virt-manager* is the graphical interface that allows to create,
  configure, and run virtual machines.

   <span class="menuchoice"> <span
   class="guimenu">File</span>&nbsp;▸ <span
   class="guimenuitem">New Virtual Machine</span></span>.

1. In *step 1*, choose **Local install media (ISO image or CDROM)**.

1. In *step 2*:

   1. **Choose ISO image**, then **Browse...**, and **Browse Local** to
      browse for the ISO image that you want to start from.

   2. Unselect **Automatically detected from the installation media / source**.

   3. Specify **Debian 11** in the field **Choose the operating system you are installing**.

1. In *step 5*:

   - Type a name of your choice for the new virtual machine.

   - Click **Finish** to start the virtual machine.

<div class="tip">

If you get the error message "<span class="guilabel">Error starting
domain: Requested operation is not valid: network 'default' is not
active</span>", then try to start the default virtual network:

<ol>
<li>Click on <span class="guilabel">QEMU/KVM - Not Connected</span>.</li>
<li>Choose <span class="menuchoice">
    <span class="guimenu">Edit</span>&nbsp;▸
    <span class="guimenuitem">Connection details</span></span> to
    administer the connection to your local
    <span class="application">QEMU</span> system.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="guilabel">Virtual Networks</span> tab, then
    select the <span class="guilabel">default</span> virtual network in
    the left pane.</li>
<li>Click on the [[!img lib/media-playback-start.png alt="Start Network"
    link=no class=symbolic]] icon on the bottom of the left pane to
    start the default virtual network.</li>
</ol>

Running Tails from a USB image
==============================

Running Tails from a USB image is the only virtualization solution that
allows you to use a Persistent Storage in a virtual machine.

1. [[Download Tails as a USB image|install/download]], instead of an ISO image.

1. Increase the size of the USB image to be at least 8 GB. This creates
   space for automatic upgrades and the Persistent Storage.

   <p class="command-template">truncate -s
   <span class="command-placeholder">size</span>
   <span class="command-placeholder">tails.img</span></p>

   - <span class="command-placeholder">size</span> has to be at least
     `7200M`.

   - <span class="command-placeholder">tails.img</span> is the file name
     of the USB image that you want to resize.

1. Start *virt-manager*.

1. Double-click on **QEMU/KVM - Not Connected** to connect to the *QEMU*
   system of your host.

1. To create a new virtual machine, choose
   <span class="menuchoice"> <span
   class="guimenu">File</span>&nbsp;▸ <span
   class="guimenuitem">New Virtual Machine</span></span>.

1. In *step 1*, choose **Import existing disk image**.

1. In *step 2*:

   1. Choose **Browse...**, and **Browse Local** to browse for the USB image
      that you want to start from.

   1. Specify **Debian 11** in the field **Choose the operating system you are
      installing**.

1. In *step 3*, allocate at least 2048 MB of RAM.

1. In *step 4*:

   1. Type a name of your choice for the new virtual machine.

   1. Choose **Customize configuration before install**.

   1. Click **Finish** to open the configuration view.

1. In the configuration view, choose **VirtIO Disk 1** or **IDE Disk 1**

   1. Set **Disk bus** to **USB**.

   1. Click **Apply**.

   1. Expand the **Advanced options**.

   1. Enable **Removable**.

   1. Click **Apply** again.

   1. Click **Begin Installation** in the top left corner to start the virtual
      machine.

After you start on the USB image, you can [[create a Persistent
Storage|persistent_storage]] on it.

<a id="usb"></a>

Running Tails from a USB stick
==============================

To run Tails from a USB stick using *virt-manager*, first
create a virtual machine running from an ISO image as described
[[above|virt-manager#iso]].

Then do the following:

  1. From the virtual machine window, choose **Virtual Machine**&nbsp;▸ **Shut
     Down**&nbsp;▸ **Force Off** to shut down the virtual machine.

  1. Plug in the USB stick from which you want to run Tails.

  1. Choose **View**&nbsp;▸ **Details** to edit the configuration of the
     virtual machine.

  1. Click on the **Add Hardware** button on the bottom of the left
     pane.

  1. Select **USB Host Device** in the left pane.

  1. In the right pane, click on the device from which you want to run
     Tails, and click **Finish**.

You can keep the original ISO image connected as a virtual DVD to
install Tails onto the USB stick if needed.

<a id="disconnect"></a>

You can also disconnect the original ISO image and start directly from the
USB stick once Tails is already installed on it. To do so:

  1. Shut down the virtual machine.

  1. In the configuration of the virtual machine, click on **SATA CDROM
     1** in the left pane.

  1. Click on the **Disconnect** button in the right pane.

  1. To enable the USB stick as a boot option:

     1. Click on **Boot Options** in the left pane.

     1. Select the **USB** boot option corresponding to your USB device.

     1. Click **Apply**.

  1. To start the virtual machine choose **View**&nbsp;▸ **Console** and then
     **Virtual Machine**&nbsp;▸ **Run**.

After you start on the USB device, you can [[create a Persistent
Storage|persistent_storage]] on it.

# Troubleshooting

<a id="graphics-issues"></a>

## Graphics issues

Issues with graphics support in Tails running inside a virtual machine
with *virt-manager* are common. The best solution can vary depending
on the version of the virtualization software and on the virtual
machine configuration. For example:

- The *Auto resize VM with window* feature does not work in all
  configurations.

- The video device that provides optimal graphics performance can be
  different depending on the version of the host operating system.

To troubleshoot such issues:

1. Ensure the virtual machine has a *Spice* display and a *Spice*
   channel configured, as opposed to *VNC* ones.

2. Try various virtual video device models.

   Start with *Virtio* and *QXL* video devices: they generally give
   the best results. If they don't perform well for you, try every
   other video device model.

3. Try enabling or disabling the OpenGL and 3D acceleration options
   of the display and video device.
