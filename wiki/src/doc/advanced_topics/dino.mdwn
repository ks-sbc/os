[[!meta title="Chatting with Dino and OMEMO"]]

[*Dino*](https://dino.im/) is a
modern, open-source Jabber/XMPP chat client. *Dino*
supports end-to-end encryption using [OMEMO](https://conversations.im/omemo/).

To learn how to install and use *Dino* in
Tails, see [this tutorial](https://t-hinrichs.net/DinoTails/DinoTails_recent.html).

<div class="bug">

<p>The tutorial linked above is outdated since Tails 5.0 (May 2022). See [[!tails_ticket 19104]].</p>

We are considering *Dino* as an option to
replace [[*Pidgin*|doc/anonymous_internet/pidgin]] in Tails.
