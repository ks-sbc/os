If your Wi-Fi interface is not working, you might experience the following:

* There is no **Wi-Fi** menu in the system menu:

  [[!img no-wifi/system_without_wifi.png link="no" class="screenshot" alt=""]]

* There is a **Wi-Fi** menu in the system menu, but connecting to a Wi-Fi
  network fails.

* The interface is disabled because MAC address anonymization failed:

  [[!img no-wifi/mac_spoofing_disabled.png link="no" class="screenshot" alt="Notification: MAC address anonymization failed"]]

  In this case, you can disable MAC address anonymization in the Welcome
  Screen. Doing so has security implications, so read carefully our
  [[documentation about MAC address
  anonymization|first_steps/welcome_screen/mac_spoofing]].

* The following notification appears:

      Activation of network connection failed

To connect to the Internet, you can try to:

* Use an Ethernet cable instead of Wi-Fi if possible. Wired interfaces work
  much more reliably than Wi-Fi in Tails.

* Share the Wi-Fi or mobile data connection of your phone using a
  USB cable. Sharing a connection this way is called *USB tethering*.

  See instructions for:

  * [iPhones or iPads](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204023)

    Only sharing mobile data works on iPhones and iPads; sharing Wi-Fi does not work.

  <div class="caution">
  <p>Tails cannot hide the information that identifies your phone on the local
  network. If you connect your phone to a:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Wi-Fi network: the network can see the MAC
  address of your phone.</p>
  <p>This has security implications that we explain in our [[documentation on
  MAC address anonymization|first_steps/welcome_screen/mac_spoofing]].  Some
  phones have a feature to hide the MAC address of the phone.</p></li>
  <li><p>Mobile data network: the network is able to know the identifier of
  your SIM card (IMSI) and the serial number of your phone (IMEI).</p></li>
  </ul>

* Buy a USB Wi-Fi adapter that works in Tails:

  <p>If you find another USB Wi-Fi adapter that works in Tails, please let us
  know. You can write to [[support@tails.net]] (private email).</p>

  if there is a workaround to get your Wi-Fi interface to work in Tails.
