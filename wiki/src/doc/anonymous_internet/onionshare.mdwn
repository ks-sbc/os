[[!meta title="Sharing files, websites, and chat rooms using OnionShare"]]

[*OnionShare*](https://onionshare.org/) allows you to create secure, anonymous,
and disposable services that other people can connect to.

To start *OnionShare*, choose **Applications**&nbsp;▸ **Internet**&nbsp;▸
**OnionShare**.

From the welcome screen of *OnionShare*, you can choose between 4 different
services:

- Share files

- Receive files

- Host a website

- Chat anonymously

[[!img services.png link="no" class="screenshot" alt=""]]

All these services are provided as Tor onion services and are only available
through the Tor network. You can share the address of these onion services with
other people to create temporary and anonymous communication channels.

People who know their onion addresses can connect to these services from *Tor
Browser*, either in Tails or outside of Tails.

<div class="tip">

<p>Unlike most Internet services, people using your <i>OnionShare</i> services
connect directly to your Tails over the Tor network. Your data is never shared
with or stored on any third-party server. Your Tails becomes a temporary and
anonymous server.</p>

</div>

These services become unavailable as soon as you close *OnionShare* or shut
down Tails.

<div class="bug">

<p><i>OnionShare</i> uses different onion addresses each time.</p>

<p>In the future, want to make it possible to store the onion addresses used by
<i>OnionShare</i> to the Persistent Storage. ([[!tails_ticket 20136]])</p>
