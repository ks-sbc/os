The *Unsafe Browser* does not use Tor. The websites that you visit can
see your real IP address.

This is why we recommend that you:

- Only use the *Unsafe Browser* to sign in to a network using a captive portal
  or [[browse trusted web pages on the local
  network|advanced_topics/lan#browser]].

- Close the *Unsafe Browser* after signing in to the network.
