To sign in to a network using a captive portal:

1. Try visiting an innocent-looking website that is common in your
   location, for example, a search engine or news site:

   - <a href="http://google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>

   - <a href="http://linkedin.com/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>

   - <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank"/>DuckDuckGo</a>

   - <a href="http://baidu.com/" target="_blank"/>Baidu</a>

1. If you are redirected to a captive portal, sign in to the network.

   If you are not redirected to a captive portal and the website loads,
   this means that you are already connected to the Internet. Close
   <span class="warning">this browser</span>
   <span class="doc">the <i>Unsafe Browser</i></span>
   and try connecting to the Tor network again.

1. After Tails is connected to Tor, close
   <span class="warning">this browser.</span>
   <span class="doc">the <i>Unsafe Browser</i>.</span>

   <div class="caution">

   <p>It is particularly important that you close the <i>Unsafe Browser</i> if
   you use accessibility features like the Screen Keyboard or the Screen Reader.
   If you keep the <i>Unsafe Browser</i> open, a very advanced network attacker
   might use it to deanonymize you.</p>

   </div>

   You can use *Tor Browser* or any other application as usual.
