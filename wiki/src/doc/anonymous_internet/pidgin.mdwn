[[!meta title="Chatting with Pidgin and OTR"]]

For chatting and instant messaging, Tails includes the <span class="application">[Pidgin Instant
Messenger](https://pidgin.im/)</span>.

<div class="note">

<p><a href="https://dino.im/"><i>Dino</i></a> is
being considered as an option to replace <i>Pidgin</i>
in Tails.</p>

<p>You can already try using <i>Dino</i> in Tails. See our
documentation on [[chatting with <i>Dino</i> and OMEMO|doc/advanced_topics/dino]].</p>

</div>

You can use *Pidgin* to connect to [[!wikipedia Internet_Relay_Chat desc="IRC"]] or [[!wikipedia XMPP]]
(also known as Jabber) servers. You can have several accounts connected at
the same time.

Even though *Pidgin* supports other protocols, it is only possible to use IRC
and XMPP with *Pidgin* in Tails for security reasons.

To start *Pidgin* choose **Applications**&nbsp;▸ **Internet**&nbsp;▸ **Pidgin**.

For more documentation, visit the official [*Pidgin*
FAQ](https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Using%20Pidgin).

<h1 id="otr">OTR encryption</h1>

[OTR (Off-the-Record)](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/) encryption allows you to
have private conversations over instant messaging by providing:

- **Encryption**

  No one else can read your instant messages.

- **Authentication**

  You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.

- **Deniability**

  The messages you send do not have digital signatures
  that are checkable by a third party. Anyone can forge messages after
  a conversation to make them look like they came from you.
  However, during a conversation, your correspondent is assured
  the messages are authentic and unmodified.

- **Perfect forward secrecy**

  If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation is compromised.

<div class="caution">

<p>OTR is deactivated by default, and your conversations are
not private.</p>

</div>

<div class="caution">

<p>File transfers are not encrypted by OTR. OTR only encrypts conversations.</p>

</div>

<div class="tip">

<p>To store your OTR keys and <i>Pidgin</i> settings across different Tails sessions,
you can turn on the [[Pidgin Internet Messenger|persistent_storage/configure#pidgin]]
feature of the Persistent Storage.</p>

</div>

<div class="caution">

<p>In a private OTR conversation over IRC, a message sent using the
<code>/me</code> command is not encrypted. The person receiving
the message is notified by a warning.</p>

IRC servers blocking Tor
========================

Some IRC servers block connections from Tor because
Tor is sometimes used to send spam.
