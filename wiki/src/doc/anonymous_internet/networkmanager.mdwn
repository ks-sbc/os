Connecting to a local network
=============================

You can connect to a local network using a wired, Wi-Fi, or mobile data
connection:

1. Open the system menu in the top-right corner.

   - If a wired connection is detected, Tails automatically connects to the network.

   - To connect to a Wi-Fi network, click [[!img lib/go-next.png
     link="no" class="symbolic" alt=""]] on the right of the **Wi-Fi** button.

     A list of available Wi-Fi networks appears below the **Wi-Fi** button.

     <div class="bug">

     <p>If there is no <b>Wi-Fi</b> menu, your Wi-Fi interface might not
     be compatible with Tails. See [[Troubleshooting Wi-Fi not
     working|no-wifi]].</p>

     </div>

   - To connect to a mobile data network, choose
     <span class="guilabel">Mobile Broadband</span>.

   <div class="note">

   <p>It is currently impossible to [[use a VPN in
   Tails|support/faq#vpn]].</p>

   </div>

1. After you connect to a local network, the *Tor Connection* assistant
   appears to help you [[connect to the Tor network|tor]].

Saving your network settings
============================

To remember the password for Wi-Fi networks and custom network configurations
across different Tails sessions, turn on the [[Network
Connections|persistent_storage/configure#network_connections]] feature of
the Persistent Storage.

Modifying your network settings
===============================

To modify your network settings, for example, to configure whether or not
to automatically connect to a Wi-Fi network, choose
**Applications&nbsp;▸ System Tools&nbsp;▸ Settings&nbsp;▸ Network**.
