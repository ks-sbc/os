[[!meta title="Migrating OpenPGP configuration from Enigmail in Thunderbird 78"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

Since Tails 4.13 (November 2020), *Thunderbird* 78 replaces the
*Enigmail* extension with built-in support for OpenPGP encryption.

If you used *Enigmail* before Tails 4.13, follow the instructions below to
migrate from *Enigmail* to *Thunderbird* 78. Tails does not include *Enigmail*
2.2, the last version of the extension, which automates this migration.

FAQ](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/openpgp-thunderbird-howto-and-faq).

   account.

<h2 id="primary-password">Set up a Primary Password</h2>

In *Thunderbird* 78, OpenPGP private keys are not protected by a passphrase.
That's why we recommend that you set up a Primary Password.

With a Primary Password, your private key is encrypted in your
*Thunderbird* profile and is only unlocked while *Thunderbird* is running.
If your *Thunderbird* profile is stored in your Persistent Storage, then
your private key is encrypted twice: once by *Thunderbird* in your
profile and a second time by the encryption of the Persistent Storage.

1. Choose **[[!img lib/open-menu.png alt="Menu" class="symbolic"
   link="no"]]&nbsp;▸ Settings**.

1. Choose **Privacy & Security**.

1. In the **Passwords** section, select the option **Use a Primary
   Password**.

1. In the **Primary Password** dialog, enter your Primary Password
   and click **OK**.

<h2 id="export-public">Export the public keys using <em>Kleopatra</em></h2>

From the desktop:

   You can use **Shift+click** and **Ctrl+click** to select multiple keys.

   From File.**

1. Choose the file containing the public keys that you exported from

   these public keys into several smaller files. *Thunderbird* can only import
   public key files of less than 5 MB.

<h2 id="accept-public">Mark the public keys as accepted</h2>

By default, new public keys are not marked as "*accepted*" by *Thunderbird* and
you cannot encrypt emails to "unaccepted" keys.

   link="no"]]&nbsp;▸ Tools&nbsp;▸ OpenPGP Key Manager**.
