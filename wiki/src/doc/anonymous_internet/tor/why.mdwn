[[!meta title="Why does Tails use Tor?"]]

[[!toc]]

Both Tails and the Tor *software* are made by the
[Tor Project](https://torproject.org/).

Tails [[was founded|news/celebrating_10_years]] in 2009 and [[joined forces
with Tor|news/tails_tor]] in 2024.

<h1 id="anonymity">Anonymity enforcement</h1>

We want to enforce good security by default for our users. That is why it is a
fundamental assumption of Tails to force all outgoing traffic to anonymity
networks such as Tor.

Over the years Tor has become a big network with a lot of capacity and a good
speed.

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) could be faster than Tor but they are not
anonymity networks, because the administrators of the VPN can know both where
you are connecting from and where you are connecting to and break your
anonymity. Tor provides anonymity
by making it impossible for a single point in the network to know both the
origin and the destination of a connection.

When using a VPN, an attacker can also break your anonymity by monitoring the
incoming and outgoing connections of the few servers of the VPN. On the other
hand, the Tor network is formed by over 7500 relays run worldwide by volunteers.

<h1 id="popularity">User base</h1>

Tor is the anonymity network with the largest user base. More than
4&thinsp;000&thinsp;000 users connected to Tor daily in 2023. Being adopted by such a
large audience proves its maturity, stability, and usability.

Tor is being used equally by journalists, law enforcement, governments, human
rights activists, business leaders, militaries, abuse victims and average
citizens concerned about online privacy. This diversity actually provides
stronger anonymity to everyone as it makes it more difficult to identify or
target a specific profile of Tor user. Anonymity loves company.

Technical merits and recognition
================================

Tor has partnered with leading research institutions, and has been subjected to
intensive academic research. It is the anonymity network which benefits from
the most auditing and peer review.

Tor has been received awards by institutions such as the [Electronic Frontier
Foundation](https://www.eff.org/awards/pioneer/2012), and the [Free Software
Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/news/2010-free-software-awards-announced) to
name a few.

An extract of a Top Secret appraisal by the NSA characterized Tor as "[the King
of high secure, low latency Internet
anonymity](https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-high-secure-internet-anonymity)"
with "no contenders for the throne in waiting".

<h1 id="i2p">About I2P</h1>

[I2P](https://geti2p.net/) is another anonymity network and alternative to Tor.
Tails used to include I2P until 2017. We removed I2P in [[Tails
2.12|news/version_2.11]] because it was too costly to maintain.

We have no plans to add I2P back in Tails because I2P hasn't yet become popular
and usable enough to matter to our [[target audience|contribute/personas]].
