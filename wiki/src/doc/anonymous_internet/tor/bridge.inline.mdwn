  To learn about other Tor bridges, you have several options listed below.

  <div class="tip">
  <p>None of these options is easy to do from Tails, so we recommend that you
  learn about several bridges from your regular computer <i>before starting
  Tails</i> and store the bridge lines in a text document on separate USB
  stick.</p>

  <p>After you restarted on Tails, you can copy one of these bridge lines from
  this other USB stick into <i>Tor Connection</i>.</p>

  </div>

  Even someone who knows your bridge cannot know what you are doing online from
  Tails.

  - **CAPTCHA**

    You can solve a CAPTCHA on [https://bridges.torproject.org/](https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?transport=obfs4).

    We recommend doing so from a different
    local network if you want to hide that you are connecting to Tor.

  - **Email**

    You can send an empty email to
    <a href="mailto:bridges@torproject.org">bridges@torproject.org</a> from a
    Gmail or Riseup email address.

    Sending the email reveals to Gmail or Riseup that you are trying to
    connect to Tor but not to someone who monitors your Internet connection.

  - **Telegram**

    You can send the message `/bridges` to
    [@GetBridgesBot](https://t.me/GetBridgesBot) on *Telegram*.
