<div class="caution">

<p>Most files contain metadata, which is information used to describe,
identify, categorize, and sort files. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cameras record data about when and where a picture was taken and what
camera was used.</li>
<li>Office documents automatically add author
and company information to texts and spreadsheets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Use [[<i>Metadata Cleaner</i>|doc/sensitive_documents/metadata]] to clean
metadata from your files before sharing them.</p>
