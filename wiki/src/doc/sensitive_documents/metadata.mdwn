What is metadata?
=================

Metadata is "data about data" or "information about information" that is embedded
in computer files, usually automatically. Metadata is used to describe,
identify, categorize, and sort files.

However, metadata can also be used to deanonymize users and expose
private information.

Examples of metadata include:

- In images:

  * The location where a photo was taken

  * The date and time a photo was taken

  * The model and serial number of the camera used to take a photo

- In other documents:

  * The author of the document

  * Changes to the document

To learn more about how metadata can be used to identify and reveal personal information, see
[Behind the Data: Investigating metadata](https://exposingtheinvisible.org/en/guides/behind-the-data-metadata-investigations/).

Removing metadata using *Metadata Cleaner*
==========================================

Tails includes
[*Metadata Cleaner*](https://metadatacleaner.romainvigier.fr/)
so you can remove metadata from files before you publish or share them.

<div class="tip">

<p>If, instead of cleaning your own files, you want to sanitize untrusted
documents shared with you by others, you can install
[[<i>Dangerzone</i>|persistent_storage/additional_software/dangerzone]] as
additional software.</p>

</div>

*Metadata Cleaner* works on many file formats, including:

- Images, such as .jpg, .gif, .svg, .tiff, and .png

- *Microsoft Office* documents, such as .docx, .xlsx, and .pptx

- *LibreOffice* documents, such as .odt and .ods

- Audio files, such as .mp3, .flac, and .ogg

- Video files, such as .mp4 and .avi

- Archive files, such as .zip and .tar

- PDFs

To open *Metadata Cleaner* choose **Applications**&nbsp;▸
**Accessories** &nbsp;▸ **Metadata Cleaner**.

<div class="caution">

<p>It is impossible to reliably find and remove all metadata in complex file
formats. For example, <i>Microsoft Office</i> documents can contain embedded images,
audio, and other files containing their own metadata that Tails cannot
remove.</p>

<p>You should remove metadata on any files before you embed them into another
document.</p>

<p>Also, you should save files in simpler formats whenever possible.
For example, instead of saving a text document as a .docx file,
you can save the document as a plain .txt file.</p>

</div>

Removing metadata from the command line
=======================================

*Metadata Cleaner* is a graphical interface for
[*mat2*](https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2).

You can also use *mat2* directly on the command line:

1. Open a *Terminal*.

1. Execute the following command.

   Replace <span class="command-placeholder">file.ext</span> with a path to the
   file that you want to clean.

   <p class="command-template">mat2 <span class="command-placeholder">file.ext</span></p>

1. After *mat2* finishes, a copy of your file without metadata is available as
   <span class="command-placeholder">file.cleaned.ext</span>.
