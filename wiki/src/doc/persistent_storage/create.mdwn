[[!meta title="Creating the Persistent Storage"]]

To create the Persistent Storage, choose **Applications**&nbsp;▸
**Tails**&nbsp;▸ **Persistent Storage**.

When run for the first time, or after [[deleting a previous Persistent
Storage|delete]], an assistant allows you to create a Persistent Storage in the
free space left on the USB stick.

<div class="note">

<p>If you get the error message <i>Sorry, impossible to create a Persistent
Storage on this device</i>, you need to follow our instructions on [[installing
Tails on a USB stick|install]].</p>

<p>If you receive the error message while running Tails using
<i>virt-manager</i>, then you need to
[[run Tails from our USB image|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/virt-manager#usb_image]]
instead of our ISO image.</p>
