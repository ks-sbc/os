1. The data corresponding to each feature of the Persistent Storage that is
   turned on is automatically available. For example:

     **Places**&nbsp;â–¸ **Persistent**, if the [[Persistent
     Folder|configure#persistent_folder]] feature is turned on.

   - Your persistent bookmarks are available in *Tor Browser*, if the [[Tor
     Browser Bookmarks|configure#bookmarks]] feature is turned on.

   - Your [[Additional Software|additional_software]] packages are automatically
     installed when starting Tails, if the [[Additional
     Software|configure#additional_software]] feature is turned on.
