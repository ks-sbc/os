<!-- We should get rid of this warning once we have
     #8436 (Wipe the LUKS header when deleting a persistent volume). -->

<p>This technique might not prevent a strong attacker from
recovering files from an old Persistent Storage using advanced data
recovery techniques, especially if
the Persistent Storage had a weak passphrase.</p>
