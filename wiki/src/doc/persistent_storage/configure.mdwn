[[!meta title="Configuring the Persistent Storage"]]

To configure the Persistent Storage, choose
**Applications**&nbsp;▸ **Tails**&nbsp;▸ **Persistent Storage**.

Since Tails 5.8 (December 2022), your data corresponding to each feature of the
Persistent Storage is stored to the USB stick immediately. You don't have to
restart Tails anymore after enabling a new feature.

For example, when you enable the Tor Browser Bookmarks feature of the
Persistent Storage, your current bookmarks are saved in the Persistent Storage
immediately.

<div class="note">

<p>Only the features that are listed below can currently be made
persistent.</p>

<p>We are often asked to implement new features of the Persistent Storage: Tor
Browser preferences, Tor configuration, desktop background, mouse and touchpad
settings, and so on. See the [[!tails_gitlab
groups/tails/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=✓&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=C%3APersistence

<a id="additional_software"></a>

<div class="icon">
[[!img lib/apps/package-x-generic.png link="no" alt=""]]
<div class="text"><h2>Additional Software</h2></div>
</div>

When the Additional Software feature is turned on, a list of
[[additional software|additional_software]] of
your choice is automatically installed every
time you start Tails.

The corresponding software packages are stored in the
Persistent Storage. They are automatically upgraded for security after
a network connection is established.

<div class="caution">

<p>The packages included in Tails are carefully tested for security.
Installing additional packages might break the security built in Tails,
so [[be careful with what you install|additional_software#warning]].</p>

</div>

<a id="dotfiles"></a>

<div class="icon">
[[!img lib/apps/preferences-desktop.png link="no" alt=""]]
<div class="text"><h2>Dotfiles</h2></div>
</div>

When the Dotfiles feature is turned on:

- All the files in the
  */live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles* folder
  are linked in the *Home* folder using Linux symbolic links.

- All the files in subfolders of
  */live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles* are also linked in the
  corresponding subfolder of the *Home* folder using Linux symbolic links.

- A shortcut is provided in the left pane of the *Files* browser and in the
  **Places** menu in the top navigation bar to access the
  */live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles* folder.

For example, having the following files in
*/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles*:

    /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles
    ├── file_a
    ├── folder
    │   ├── file_b
    │   └── subfolder
    │       └── file_c
    └── emptyfolder

Produces the following result in */home/amnesia*:

    /home/amnesia
    ├── file_a → /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles/file_a
    └── folder
        ├── file_b → /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles/folder/file_b
        └── subfolder
            └── file_c → /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles/folder/subfolder/file_c

<div class="note">

<p>The Dotfiles feature only links specific files, and not entire folders, from
the Persistent Storage. Accordingly, empty folders are ignored, as shown in
the above example.</p>

</div>

On Tails and Linux in general, the name of configuration files often starts
with a dot and are sometimes called [[!wikipedia dotfiles]] for this reason.
The Dotfiles feature of the Persistent Storage makes it easy to persist such
"*dotfiles*", for example */home/amnesia/.gitconfig* or */home/amnesia/.bashrc*.

<div class="caution">

<p>Be careful if you use the Dotfiles feature to overwrite the default
settings.</p>

<p>The programs included in Tails are carefully configured with security in
mind. You can weaken your security if you change the defaults.</p>

<p>The anonymity of Tor and Tails relies on making it harder to distinguish one
Tails user from another. In some cases, changing the default settings can break
your anonymity.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="displays">Save the configuration of your displays</h3>

If you have more than one display (for example, two monitors or a

<span class="guilabel">Dotfiles</span> feature.

1. Choose **Applications**&nbsp;▸ **System Tools**&nbsp;▸ **Settings** to open the *Settings* utility.

1. Choose **Displays** in the *Settings* utility.

1. Configure your displays.

1. Choose **Places**&nbsp;▸ **Dotfiles**
   to open the <span class="filename">/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles</span> folder
   in the <span class="application">Files</span> browser.

1. Click the [[!img lib/open-menu.png alt="Main Menu" class="symbolic" link="no"]]
   button in the title bar and turn on the option **Show Hidden Files**.

1. Create a folder called <span class="filename">.config</span>
   (<span class="filename">config</span> preceded by a dot).

1. Copy the <span class="filename">.config/monitors.xml</span> file from
   your <span class="filename">Home</span> folder to
   <span class="filename">/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles/.config</span>.

Deleting the data corresponding to a feature
============================================

When you turn off a feature of the Persistent Storage:

- The data of the feature is not available anymore in Tails.

  For example:

  * If you turn off the Persistent Folder feature, the documents saved in
    **Places** &nbsp;▸ **Persistent** are not available anymore.

  * If you turn off the Electrum Bitcoin Wallet feature, the wallet used by
    *Electrum* is not available anymore.

- The data of the feature is still saved in the USB stick.

  A **Delete Data** button appears in the setting of the feature.

  [[!img delete_data.png link="no" alt=""]]

  * Click the **Delete Data** button to delete the corresponding data from the
    USB stick.

  * Turn on the feature again to restore the data and make it available in
    Tails again.
