Which additional software can I install in Tails?
=================================================

Tails includes a [[limited set of applications|doc/about/features]] but
you can install more software.

This software is distributed in packages that are made available from the Debian repositories,
which are similar to an app store.

To know which packages are available in Debian:

- Browse locally with
  the <span class="application">Synaptic Package Manager</span>:

  1. When starting Tails, [[set up an administration password|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password]].

  1. Choose <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Synaptic Package Manager</span></span>.

  1. Wait until <span class="application">Synaptic</span> finishes downloading new package information
     from the Debian servers.

  1. You can:

     - Browse the packages by sections from the left sidebar.

     - Search on titles and descriptions of packages with the <span class="bold">Search</span> button.

- Search the Internet for alternatives to other software.

  For example: "*debian alternatives to photoshop*".

- Ask a friend who is knowledgeable about Linux.

- Search the [Debian website](https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages#search_packages).

Be careful about what you install
---------------------------------

<div class="caution">

<p>The packages included in Tails are carefully tested for security.
Installing additional packages might break the security built in Tails. For
example, installing OpenVPN might modify the firewall rules that Tails uses to
force network traffic to go through Tor. So, be careful with what you
install.</p>

</div>

If you are unsure:

- Packages that use the network need to be configured to go through
  Tor. They are otherwise blocked from accessing the network.

- Some software might, for example, modify the firewall and break the security
  built in Tails. But other software like games or office tools are probably fine.

- Software not [[officially included in Tails|doc/about/features]] might have not been tested for security.
  We also cannot provide support or documentation for it.

- Only applications that are packaged for Debian can be installed and they are
  under [[public scrutiny|doc/about/trust#trust_debian]].

Examples of additional useful software
======================================

- [*VLC*](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/), a multimedia player with advanced
  features.

- [*Pitivi*](https://www.pitivi.org/), a video editor.

- [*Scribus*](https://www.scribus.net/), a page layout application.

- [*Cheese*](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Cheese), an application
  to take pictures and videos from your webcam.

- [*Mumble*](https://www.mumble.info/), a voice chat application.

- [*Calibre*](https://calibre-ebook.com/), an EPUB reader and library manager.

- [*GtkHash*](https://gtkhash.org/), a utility to calculate the checksum of files.

Language packages and dictionaries
----------------------------------

Replace <span class="command-placeholder">lang</span> with the code for your
language. For example, `vi` for Vietnamese.

Tails already includes language packages and dictionaries for Arabic,
German, Spanish, Farsi, French, Hindi, Bahasa Indonesia, Italian,
Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, and Simplified Chinese.

- *LibreOffice* language package: <code>libreoffice-l10n-<span class="command-placeholder">lang</span></code>

  [List of available *LibreOffice* language packages](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=libreoffice-l10n&searchon=names&suite=stable&section=all)

- *Thunderbird* language package: <code>thunderbird-l10n-<span class="command-placeholder">lang</span></code>

  [List of available *Thunderbird* language packages](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=thunderbird-l10n&searchon=names&suite=stable&section=all)

- *Hunspell* dictionnary: <code>hunspell-<span class="command-placeholder">lang</span></code>

  The *Hunspell* dictionaries are used for spell-checking by *Tor Browser*,
  *LibreOffice*, *Thunderbird*, and many other applications.

Installing additional software
==============================

To install a package using <span class="application">Synaptic</span>:

1. When starting Tails, [[set up an administration password|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password]].

1. Choose <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Synaptic Package Manager</span></span>.

1. Click <span class="bold">Search</span> and search for the name of the package.

1. Right-click (on Mac, click with two fingers) on the name of the package in the search results and choose <span class="guimenuitem">Mark for
   Installation</span>.

1. <span class="application">Synaptic</span> calculates the additional changes for your package to work. Click <span class="bold">Mark</span> to confirm those changes.

1. Click <span class="bold">Apply</span> to download, install, and
   configure the package.

<div class="tip">

<p>If you are comfortable with the command line, you can use <code>apt</code> instead.</p>

</div>

Installing additional software automatically when starting Tails
----------------------------------------------------------------

To install an additional package automatically when starting Tails:

1. Turn on the [[Additional
   Software|persistent_storage/configure#additional_software]] feature of the
   Persistent Storage.

1. Install the package using *Synaptic* or
   the `apt` command.

1. After the package is installed,
   a notification appears to ask if you want to install this package
   every time you start Tails in the future.

   [[!img add.png link="no" class="screenshot" alt=""]]

   - If you choose <span class="bold">Install Every Time</span>,
     the package is saved in the Persistent Storage and will be reinstalled
     automatically every time you start Tails.

     The package will also be updated automatically when you connect to the
     Internet.

   - If you choose <span class="bold">Install Only Once</span>, the
     package is also saved in the Persistent Storage but won't be
     reinstalled automatically every time you start Tails.

The same package can be reinstalled faster for some time because you
won't have to download it again.

Using additional software
=========================

Once installed, applications that don't use the network usually work
out of the box.
However, Tails has some differences in terms of
additional configuration and network access.

Additional configuration
------------------------

To save the configuration of additional software across different Tails
sessions, you can use the [[Dotfiles|persistent_storage/configure#dotfiles]]
feature of the Persistent Storage.

Each application handles its configuration very differently, so we cannot give
general instructions on which files have to be saved using the Dotfiles
features.

Network access
--------------

Tails only allows connections to the Tor network. Additional software that uses
the Internet must be configured to go through the Tor network otherwise, their
connections are blocked by default for security.

To make an application use the Tor network, you can either:

A. Configure the application to use Tor as a proxy with the following parameters:

   * Type: SOCKS5
   * Host: 127.0.0.1
   * Port: 9050

   For example, to use *Mumble* in Tails, you can configure Tor as proxy in the
   network configuration of *Mumble*:

   [[!img mumble.png link="no" alt="Network configuration of Mumble with proxy settings"]]

B. Run the application using `torsocks` on the command line.

   Execute the following command in a *Terminal*. Replace <span
   class="command-placeholder">application</span> with the command line of the
   application that you want to run:

   <p class="command-template">torsocks <span class="command-placeholder">application</span></p>

   For example, to use *Mumble* in Tails, you can also execute the following
   command:

   <p class="command">torsocks mumble</p>

### Technical networking considerations

- Only TCP connections can go through the Tor network.

- UDP connections, for example in many VoIP applications, and ICMP connections,
  for example in the `ping` utility, cannot go through the Tor network and are
  blocked in Tails.

- DNS requests go through the Tor network if the application uses the system
  configuration otherwise, DNS requests will fail to resolve.

- IPv6 connections are blocked in Tails.

- The default Tor port in Tails (9050) forces the use of different Tor circuits
  for each different destination IP and port, also called "*stream isolation*".

Checking your list of additional software
=========================================

To see which packages are installed automatically
every time you start Tails, choose <span class="menuchoice">
   <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guimenuitem">Additional Software</span></span>.

Click the <span class="bold">[[!img lib/window-close.png
class="symbolic" link="no" alt=""]]</span> button to remove a package from the list.

The same list is also available from the Persistent Storage settings, by clicking on the
[[!img lib/emblem-system.png class="symbolic" link="no"]] button of the <span class="guilabel">Additional
Software</span> feature.

Removing additional software
============================

When you installed the package, if you chose:

- <span class="bold">Install Only Once</span>, you can remove it by restarting Tails.

- <span class="bold">Install Every Time</span>, you can remove it:

  - Using <span class="application">Additional Software</span>:

    1. Choose <span class="menuchoice">
       <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
       <span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
       <span class="guimenuitem">Additional Software</span></span>.

    1. Click the <span class="bold">[[!img lib/window-close.png
       class="symbolic" link="no" alt=""]]</span> to the right of the name
       of the package.

  - Using <span class="application">Synaptic</span>:

    1. When starting Tails, [[set up an administration password|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password]].

    1. Choose <span class="menuchoice">
       <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
       <span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
       <span class="guimenuitem">Synaptic Package Manager</span></span>.

    1. Click <span class="bold">Search</span> and search for the name of the package.

    1. Right-click (on Mac, click with two fingers) on the name of the package in the search results and choose
       <span class="guimenuitem">Mark for Removal</span>.

    1. Click <span class="bold">Apply</span> to remove the package.

  - From the command line using `apt`.

  After the package is removed, a notification appears to ask if you want to
  remove this package from your list of additional software.

  [[!img remove.png link="no" class="screenshot" alt=""]]

Freeing space in your Persistent Storage
----------------------------------------

After you installed many packages that you are not using anymore, you can free some space in your Persistent Storage:

1. When starting Tails, [[set up an administration password|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password]].

1. Choose <span class="menuchoice">
   <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guimenuitem">Root Terminal</span>
   </span> to open a <span class="application">Root Terminal</span>.

1. Execute the following command:

   <p class="command">apt clean</p>

Configuring additional APT repositories  (for advanced users)
=============================================================

<div class="caution">

<p>The packages available in Debian are
submitted to public scrutiny.</p>

<p>Configuring additional APT repositories might break the security built in
Tails and might install software that has not even been approved by Debian. Be even more careful
with what you install.</p>

<p>This step is usually not needed to install additional software and might be necessary
only in very rare occasions.</p>

</div>

Sometimes, you might need to configure additional APT repositories. For
example, to install packages from the `non-free` section of Debian. To do so:

1. When starting Tails, [[set up an administration password|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password]].

1. Create an <span class="filename">apt-sources.list.d</span> folder in your
   Persistent Storage:

   <p class="command">sudo install -d -m 755 /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/apt-sources.list.d</p>

1. As root, edit */live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/persistence.conf*,
   the configuration of the Persistent Storage, and add the
   *apt-sources.list.d* folder as a
   feature of type `link`:

       /etc/apt/sources.list.d	source=apt-sources.list.d,link

1. Write your additional `sources.list` files in the
   *apt-sources.list.d* folder.

   For example, to add
   the `non-free` sections of Debian 11 (Bullseye), backports, and security
   updates, you can create a file named
   */live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/apt-sources.list.d/non-free.list*
   with the following content:

       deb tor+http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ bullseye non-free
       deb tor+http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ bullseye-backports non-free
       deb tor+http://security.debian.org/ bullseye/updates non-free

   File names must end with *.list* and must only contain the following
   characters: letters, digits, underscore, hyphen, and period.

1. Correct the ownership and permissions of your additional `sources.list`
   files to be owned by `root` and only readable by others. For
   example:

       chown root:root /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/apt-sources.list.d/non-free.list
       chmod 644 /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/apt-sources.list.d/non-free.list

1. Restart Tails to apply the changes.
