Resetting a USB stick using the command line
============================================

<!-- Note for translators: This section is very similar to /install/inc/steps/install_with_etcher.inline. -->

1. Unplug the USB stick from the computer.

1. Open the **Terminal** utility from **Applications**&nbsp;â–¸ **Utilities**.

1. Execute the following command.

   <p class="command">diskutil list</p>

   It returns a list of the storage devices on the system. For example:

       /dev/disk0
        #:                     TYPE NAME         SIZE      IDENTIFIER
        0:    GUID_partition_scheme             *500.1 GB  disk0
        1:                      EFI              209.7 MB  disk0s1
        2:                Apple_HFS MacDrive     250.0 GB  disk0s2
        3:                      EFI              134.1 GB  disk0s3
        4:     Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP     115.5 GB  disk0s4

1. Plug in the USB stick that you want to reset.

1. Execute again the same command.

   <p class="command">diskutil list</p>

   Your USB stick appears as a new device in the list. Check
   that its size corresponds to the size of your USB stick.

       /dev/disk0
        #:                     TYPE NAME         SIZE      IDENTIFIER
        0:    GUID_partition_scheme             *500.1 GB  disk0
        1:                      EFI              209.7 MB  disk0s1
        2:                Apple_HFS MacDrive     250.0 GB  disk0s2
        3:                      EFI              134.1 GB  disk0s3
        4:     Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP     115.5 GB  disk0s4

       /dev/disk1
        #:                     TYPE NAME         SIZE      IDENTIFIER
        0:   FDisk_partition_scheme             *8.0 GB    disk1
        1:                Apple_HFS Untitled 1   8.0 GB    disk1s1

1. Take note of the device name of your USB stick.

   In this example, the USB stick is 8.0 GB and its device name is <span class="command-placeholder">/dev/disk1</span>.
   Yours might be different.

   <div class="caution">
   <p>If you are unsure about the device name, you should stop proceeding or
   <strong>you risk overwriting any hard disk on the system</strong>.</p>
   </div>

1. Execute the following command to safely eject the USB stick. Replace <span class="command-placeholder">device</span>
   with the device name found in step 6.

   <p class="command-template">diskutil unmountDisk <span class="command-placeholder">device</span></p>

1. Execute the following command to format the USB stick. Replace <span class="command-placeholder">device</span>
   with the device name found in step 6.
