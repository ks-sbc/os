There are 2 ways of shutting down Tails.

[[!toc levels=1]]

With both techniques, all the data stored in [[!wikipedia Random-access_memory
desc="RAM"]] is securely erased to protect you from [[cold boot
attacks|doc/advanced_topics/cold_boot_attacks]].

Shutdown from the system menu
=============================

Click on the system menu in the upper right corner of the screen.

* Choose [[!img lib/system-shutdown.png link="no" class="symbolic" alt="Power Off"]] to
  shutdown the computer.

* Choose [[!img lib/view-refresh.png link="no" class="symbolic" alt="Restart"]] to restart
  the computer on Tails or on your regular operating system.

Emergency shutdown
==================

To trigger an emergency shutdown, unplug the USB stick or eject the DVD from
which Tails is running. Doing so might be faster than shutting down from the
system menu.

<div class="caution">

<p>You risk breaking your Persistent Storage and losing data when you unplug
your USB stick while Tails is running.</p>

<p>If you use a Persistent Storage, only unplug your Tails USB stick in an
emergency.</p>
