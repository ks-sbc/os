[[!meta title="How can I trust Tails?"]]

[[!meta stylesheet="donate/testimonials.inline" rel="stylesheet" title=""]]

Tails will never try to harm you or any of our users, as a core principle of
our [social contract](https://community.torproject.org/policies/social_contract/). As part of that commitment, we
have written this page to help you make an informed decision about whether you
can trust Tails.

We think that Tails is a trustworthy project because:

- **Our work is public**

  - Tails is [[Free Software|about/license]] and security researchers
    can examine our [[!tails_gitlab tails/tails desc="source code"]].

  - Known issues in Tails are described publicly in our [[!tails_gitlab tails/tails/-/issues
    desc="GitLab issue tracker"]]. We might hide embargoed security
    vulnerabilities in Tails while we work on a solution, but only as a way of
    protecting our users.

  - The most sensitive parts of Tails are explained in our [[design
    documents|contribute/design]].

- **Tails is based on Tor and Debian**

  The software included in Tails is either written by us or inherited from
  Debian and other Tor projects:

  * [Debian](https://debian.org/) is the Linux distribution with the most derivatives, including Ubuntu.

    Debian and its derivatives
    are [the most popular Linux distributions on web
    servers](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-linux) across the
    Internet.

    The Debian project is coordinated over the Internet by a team of
    volunteers whose work is entirely public. All this makes Debian one of the
    Free Software projects under the most scrutiny by security researchers.

  * [Tor](https://torproject.org/) is the best anonymity network available.

    Tails is made by the Tor Project, the same organization that makes the Tor
    software and *Tor Browser*.

    Tor
    has partnered with leading research institutions and has been subjected to
    intensive academic research. Tor has received awards from institutions
    such as the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/awards/pioneer/2012) and the [Free
    Software
    Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/news/2010-free-software-awards-announced).
    Even the NSA qualified Tor as "[the King of high secure, low latency Internet
    Anonymity](https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-high-secure-internet-anonymity)."

- **Our downloads are verifiable**

  Making sure that our users are really downloading an unmodified version of
  our work is also critical to trust and security:

  * Our downloads are [[reproducible|contribute/build/reproducible]] to make
    sure that the process of building the downloads from our source code was
    not altered by our own infrastructure.

  * We provide [[strong and easy-to-use verification
    mechanisms|contribute/design/download_verification]] to make sure that our
    users are downloading a genuine copy of Tails.

  * However, Tails, like Debian, includes closed source binary firmware in
    order to work on as much hardware as possible.

- **Tails is recommended by renown and diverse people and organizations**
