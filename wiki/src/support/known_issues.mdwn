<h1 id="not-at-all">Tails not starting at all</h1>

<h2 id="mac-not-at-all">Mac</h2>

This section lists known problems with specific hardware.

Tails does not start at all on Mac models that use the Apple M1 chip and on
many other Mac models.

Apple does not prioritize collaborating with Free Software projects. Their
newest hardware is usually very hard for Free Software developers to get
working with Linux, and thus Tails. PC hardware tends to be more open and work
better with Linux.

<h2 id="sbat">Shim SBAT verification error</h2>

This section applies if you get the following error message, either when
starting Tails or when restarting your regular Linux operating system after
starting Tails.

<p class="code">
Verifying shim SBAT data failed: Security Policy Violation<br>
Something has gone seriously wrong: SBAT self-check failed: Security Policy Violation
</p>

Or

<p class="code">
Verifiying shim SBAT data failed: Security Policy Violation<br>
Something has gone seriously wrong: SBAT self-check failed: Security Policy Violation
</p>

- If you get this error message when starting Tails, then do a [[manual
  upgrade|upgrade#manual]] of your Tails USB to Tails 6.7 or later.

- If you get this error message when starting your regular Linux operating
  system, then it means that your Linux operating system is outdated.

  1. Edit your UEFI settings to disable Secure Boot.

     With Secure Boot disabled, your regular Linux operating system should
     start again.

     To learn how to edit the BIOS or UEFI settings, search for the user manual
     of the computer on the support website of the manufacturer.

  1. Update your regular Linux operating system.

  1. Try to enable Secure Boot again in your UEFI settings.

     If your regular Linux operating system still doesn't start, then disable
     Secure Boot again. You can try to enable Secure Boot again in the future.

     It might take several months for your Linux distribution to provide updates
     before you can enable Secure Boot again.


<h1 id="wifi">Networking issues</h1>

<h2 id="problematic-wifi">Problematic Wi-Fi interfaces</h2>

Check in this section
if there is a workaround to get your Wi-Fi interface work in Tails.

To know the model of your Wi-Fi interface:

1. Open <span class="application">Terminal</span> and execute the following command:

       lspci -v | grep "Network controller"

<h3 id="88w8897">88W8897 [AVASTAR] 802.11ac Wireless</h3>

Last updated: 2018-09-19

On some computers with a Marvell Avastar 88W8897 Wi-Fi adapter, such
as some Microsoft Surface Pro models, Tails fails to connect to
Wi-Fi networks.

If you experience this problem, you can try to [[disable MAC address
anonymization|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/mac_spoofing]] that sometimes
fixes it.

<h3 id="rtl8723be">RTL8723BE PCIe Wireless Network Adapter</h3>

<!--
Last updated: 2017-12-24

On some computers with a RTL8723be Wi-Fi adapter, Tails might fail to discover
Wi-Fi networks, provide unreliable Wi-Fi connections, or have poor Wi-Fi
performance.

You can try to [[add the following boot options when starting
Tails|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]] until you find a
combination that works for you. The exact combination of options that works
depends on the computer:

- <span class="command">rtl8723be.fwlps=0 rtl8723be.ips=0</span>

- <span class="command">rtl8723be.ant_sel=1</span>

- <span class="command">rtl8723be.ant_sel=2</span>

<h3 id="broadcom-sta-dkms">Broadcom Wi-Fi network interface needing <code>broadcom-sta-dkms</code></h3>

<!--
Last updated: 2019-01-29
-->

Some Broadcom Wi-Fi interfaces require the
[`wl`](https://wiki.debian.org/wl) driver, provided by the
`broadcom-sta-dkms` Debian package, to work in Tails.

The `wl` driver is not included in Tails because it is proprietary.

Your device requires the `wl` driver if it is in the list of devices
supported by the `broadcom-sta-dkms` package on the corresponding
[Debian wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/wl). If you find your device
in the list of supported devices, then it is impossible to use your
Wi-Fi card in Tails.

<h3 id="broadcom-43602">Authentication issues with Broadcom 43602</h3>

<!--
Last updated: 2024-03-28
-->

The Broadcom 43602 Wi-Fi interface asks for the password of Wi-Fi networks in a
loop when trying to connect.

To fix this, try the following, if you have an iPhone:

1. Start Tails.

1. Set up a personal Wi-Fi hotspot from your iPhone with the **Maximize
   Compatibility** option turned on.

1. Connect to your personal Wi-Fi hotspot from Tails.

1. Disconnect.

1. Connect to any other Wi-Fi network.

<h2 id="usb-gigabyte">USB devices are not working on some <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/">GIGABYTE</a> motherboards</h2>

<!--

To workaround this issue, you can try to:

- Use other USB ports. For example, use USB 2 ports instead of USB 3
  ports and vice versa.

- Enable these 3 options in the BIOS

  - xHCI handoff
  - EHCI handoff
  - IOMMU controller

- [[Add the following boot option when
  starting Tails|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]]:

      amd_iommu=on iommu=pt

- Disable IOMMU in the BIOS then enable it again.

Some of these workarounds might disable some of the USB ports.

<h2 id="graphics-corruption-tor-browser">Graphics corruption in Tor Browser and Thunderbird</h2>

On some computers, _Tor Browser_ and _Thunderbird_ are displayed incorrectly:

- The application window is initially empty and white.

- The icons and menus only appear when hovered by the mouse.

- The contents of the window is only displayed in stripes when scrolling.

To workaround this issue, [[add the following boot option when
starting Tails|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]]:

    intel_iommu=off

This problem affects at least the following computers:

- MacBookPro11,5

- Other MacBooks with a Radeon R9 graphics adapter

When using the Nvidia card of a Dell XPS 15 7590 laptop,
the system may become unresponsive while using Tails.

To fix this, start Tails with the following [[boot
option|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]]:

<h2 id="video-memory">Tails does not erase video memory</h2>

Tails doesn't erase the [[!wikipedia Video_RAM_(dual-ported_DRAM) desc="video memory"]].

When you restart your computer after using Tails, it might briefly display the
last screen that was displayed in Tails.

If you shut down your computer instead of restarting it, the video memory will
erase itself automatically after some time.

See [[!tails_ticket 5356 desc="Erase video memory on shutdown"]].
