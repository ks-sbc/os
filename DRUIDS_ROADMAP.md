## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Tor performance**: Mitigate with caching and delta sync
- **Merge conflicts**: Extensive testing and UI work
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Regular audits and bug bounties

### Organizational Risks
- **Adoption resistance**: Training and gradual rollout
- **Scope creep**: Strict milestone management
- **Burnout**: Sustainable pace and team rotation

### External Risks
- **State interference**: Fully distributed architecture
- **Funding gaps**: Multiple funding sources
- **Fork disputes**: Clear governance model

## Conclusion

This roadmap transforms KSBC OS from a privacy tool into revolutionary infrastructure. By embedding organizational best practices into technology, we ensure that movements can outlive their founders and maintain coherence across time and space.

The revolution needs infrastructure that embodies its principles. DRUIDS provides that infrastructure, making collective action feel more natural than individualism, making documentation feel easier than forgetting, making solidarity feel stronger than isolation.

Form governs function. We're building revolutionary form.
