## About KSBC Operating System

**KSBC OS** is a revolutionary operating system built on Tails that embeds organizational memory and democratic centralist principles into its technological infrastructure.

### Core Mission: Revolutionary Continuity

KSBC OS addresses the critical problem of organizational mortality in leftist movements by creating persistent, distributed, and self-replicating documentation systems. Built on the foundation of Tails' privacy and security features, KSBC OS adds:

- **Living Documentation**: Every decision, lesson, and tactic is preserved in a form that survives individual departure
- **Embedded Democratic Centralism**: Technology guides users through proper organizational methods naturally
- **Distributed Resilience**: No central server to seize, no single leader to arrest - the organization regenerates from any surviving node
- **Evolutionary Framework**: Git-based ideological development that creates pressure toward theoretical coherence

### Technical Foundation

Like Tails, KSBC OS:
- Routes all connections through Tor for privacy and censorship resistance
- Runs from USB with no trace left on the host computer
- Includes secure communication and documentation tools with safe defaults
- Is based on Debian GNU/Linux and can be verified by independent researchers

### The DRUIDS Architecture

KSBC OS implements the DRUIDS (Documentation for Revolutionary Unity, Ideological Development, and Security) system - a conceptual architecture that transforms abstract revolutionary principles into concrete technological practices. Learn more in [DRUIDS.md](./DRUIDS.md).


### How to Contribute to KSBC OS

KSBC OS welcomes contributions that align with our mission of building revolutionary organizational infrastructure. We particularly seek:

- **Documentation Architecture**: Improving systems for preserving organizational memory
- **Security Enhancements**: Strengthening resilience against state repression
- **Workflow Tools**: Creating interfaces that naturally guide democratic centralist practice
- **Translation & Localization**: Making revolutionary tools accessible across languages and cultures

### Development Principles

When contributing to KSBC OS, remember:
- **Form Governs Function**: Technology should guide users toward correct organizational practices
- **No Single Point of Failure**: Every feature must work in a distributed, resilient manner
- **Embedded Discipline**: Make the right thing easier than the wrong thing
- **Complete History**: Every change must be traceable to its origin and reasoning

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to create your own complete copy of organizational DNA
2. Review [DRUIDS.md](./DRUIDS.md) to understand the architectural principles
3. Check existing issues and discussions for current priorities
4. Document your changes thoroughly - in KSBC OS, undocumented features don't exist

### License and Revolutionary Distribution

**KSBC OS** is [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) in the deepest sense - not just free to use, but designed to liberate organizational knowledge from proprietary control.

The codebase builds upon Tails, released under GNU/GPL (version 3 or above). KSBC OS additions maintain this commitment to software freedom while extending it to organizational freedom - the right to fork, merge, and evolve revolutionary practice without permission from any central authority.

Like Tails, KSBC OS includes non-free firmware to ensure broad hardware compatibility. In the struggle against state repression, we prioritize operational security over ideological purity in driver selection.


### Contact & Coordination

In keeping with DRUIDS principles of distributed resilience, KSBC OS maintains multiple communication channels:

**Development Coordination**: Through this Git repository - issues, discussions, and pull requests
**Upstream Tails**: https://tails.net/about/contact
**Secure Communications**: Established through the OS itself using built-in encrypted messaging tools

Remember: In KSBC OS, important decisions must be documented in the repository. Ephemeral chat is for coordination, not governance.

*Building on the privacy foundation of [Tails](https://tails.net), KSBC OS adds the organizational memory and revolutionary discipline needed for movements that outlive their founders.*
