# This causes the proxies to run during the whole session, instead of
# being started and stopped when needed. The only app which needs
# the proxies and doesn't define this requirement in a systemd service
# yet is the Unsafe Browser. Once that is fixed, we can remove these
# lines (and the [Install] sections from the service files).

# tracker-extract-3.service is a helper service that is controlled by
# tracker-miner-fs-3.service. It should not be started automatically
# by systemd. In Bookworm, it has a WantedBy=default.target dependency,
# which causes it to fail after a 30s timeout because it's started
# before tracker-miner-fs-3.service, see #20243.
# TODO:Trixie: The version of tracker-extract in Trixie does not have
# dependency on default.target anymore, so we can remove this line.

# systemd-networkd fallbacks to Google's nameservers when no other nameserver
# is provided by the network configuration. As of Debian Buster,
# this service is disabled
# by default, but it feels safer to make this explicit. Besides, it might be
# that systemd-networkd vs. firewall setup ordering is suboptimal in this respect,
# so let's avoid any risk of DNS leaks here.
