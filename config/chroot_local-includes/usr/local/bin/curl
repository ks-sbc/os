# This script is a wrapper around curl that forces it to use Tor.
# We do that by setting the ALL_PROXY environment variable instead of
# using torsocks, because torsocks has issues with IPv6 and therefore
# disabled it by default (see https://forum.torproject.net/t/torsocks-release-2-4-0/3425).

# Similarly to what torsocks does with the --isolate option, we set a
# random username to make Tor use different circuits each time curl is
# called (see IsolateSOCKSAuth).
