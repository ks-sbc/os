# This file overrides the runtime permissions specified by the application
# to put us in control of what the application can access.

[Context]

# Explanations:
# * !host:reset;!host: Disallow access to any files on the host,
#   ignoring all filesystem permissions inherited from the app's
#   metadata file
# * xdg-run/speech-dispatcher: speech synthesizer support (speechd)
# * Remainder: Allow access to directories which should be accessible to
#   Tor Browser.
filesystems=!host:reset;!host;xdg-run/speech-dispatcher:ro;xdg-documents;xdg-download;xdg-music;xdg-pictures;xdg-videos;/run/tor-has-bootstrapped;~/.mozilla:create;~/.tor-browser:create;

# Explanations:
# * !x11;!fallback-x11: Disallow access to the X11 server, overriding
#   the permissions inherited from the app's metadata file.
# * cups: printing support.
sockets=!x11;!fallback-x11;cups;

# Explanations:
# * Drop useless access added by upstream
# * Allow accessibility support (a11y)

# This seems to be some DBus alternative to the Desktop Portal
# FileChooser, which is unused if Portals are enabled, which they are
# both in Tails and the org.torproject.TorBrowser flatpak.
