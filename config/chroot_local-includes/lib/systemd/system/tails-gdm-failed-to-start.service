[Unit]
Description=Guide the user when GDM fails to start
# GDM normally runs "plymouth --quit" when it fails to start GNOME Shell
# (see on_display_status_changed that calls plymouth_quit_without_transition).
# But when this happens we kill -9 GDM in our gdm-wayland-session wrapper, so it
# might not have time to quit plymouth yet. Therefore we ensure plymouth
# has quit before we start: we run after plymouth-quit.service (which is started
# by gdm.service's default OnFailure=), we have plymouth-quit-wait.service start,
# and we wait for it to complete.
After=plymouth-quit.service
Requires=plymouth-quit-wait.service
After=plymouth-quit-wait.service
