Feature: Localization
  As a Tails user
  I want Tails to be localized in my native language
  And various Tails features should still work

  Scenario Outline: Do not localize the XDG User Dirs to be able to use those dirs in Tor Browser (#19255)
    Given I have started Tails from DVD without network and stopped at Tails Greeter's login screen
    And I log in to a new session in German (de)
    Then the live user's <dir> directory exists
    And there is a GNOME bookmark for the <dir> directory
    Examples:
      | dir |
      | Documents |
      | Downloads |
      | Music |
      | Pictures |
      | Videos |

  Scenario Outline: Tails is localized for every tier-1 language
    Given I have started Tails from DVD without network and stopped at Tails Greeter's login screen
    When I log in to a new session in <language> (<lang_code>)
    Then the keyboard layout is set to "<layout>"
    When the network is plugged
    And Tor is ready
    Then I successfully start the Unsafe Browser
    And I kill the Unsafe Browser
    When I enable the screen keyboard
    Then the screen keyboard works in Tor Browser
    And DuckDuckGo is the default search engine
    And I kill the Tor Browser
    And the screen keyboard works in Thunderbird
    And the layout of the screen keyboard is set to "<osk_layout>"

    # This list has to be kept in sync' with our list of tier-1 languages:
    #   https://tails.net/contribute/how/translate/#tier-1-languages

    # Known issues, that this step effectively verifies are still present:
    #  - Not all localized layouts exist in the GNOME screen keyboard: #8444
    #  - Arabic's layout should be "ara": #12638
    Examples:
      | language   | layout | osk_layout | lang_code |
      | Arabic     | us     | us         | ar    |
      | Chinese    | cn     | us         | zh_CN |
      | English    | us     | us         | en    |
      | French     | fr     | fr         | fr    |
      | German     | de     | de         | de    |
