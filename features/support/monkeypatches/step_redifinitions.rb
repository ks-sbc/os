  # This class is only used when the cucumber --guess option was
  # given, or if that option was enabled dynamically when running
  # reload_code(). We don't care about cucumber's normal guessing
  # since we are careful about not writing ambiguous step patterns
  # so instead we hijack it to resolve ambiguous step definitions
  # after reloading code with that step by using the last one that
  # was loaded.

  # code is reloaded all steps are instatiated as RbStepDefinition
  # again, but we also have to modify existing instances or else
  # cucumber will use the old definitions since it already has
  # matched each step read from the .feature files to these old
  # instances.
