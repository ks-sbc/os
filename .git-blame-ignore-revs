# This configuration, once enabled, makes `git blame` ignore specific commits
# that would make its output less useful, such as automated code reformatting.
#
# To enable this configuration, run in this repository:
#
#     git config --local blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# For a longer explanation, see https://michaelheap.com/git-ignore-rev/ :)
